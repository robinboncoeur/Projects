## Alice Mary Smith

**[Symphony in C, the First Movement](https://musescore.com/user/29275325/scores/8508848)**

I am trying to be faithful to the over-arching message of the film 'Portrait de la Jeune Fille en Feu', by bringing works by women, which during their time may have received considerable acclaim, but which a patriarchal history subsequently suppressed, out of the shadows of obscurity into the light of being performed.  
Alice Mary Smith is one such composer.

Alice was a big admirer of Felix Mendelssohn, as am I. Her admiration is quite apparent in this first movement of her C minor Symphony. This first movement is magical!

I transcribed this work into Musescore from a PDF of a handwritten manuscript of Alice Mary Smith's Symphony in C, the First Movement. The pdf of the manuscript can be [found here](https://archive.org/details/GB-Lam_MS1671).

My original transcription was done in Musescore 3.6.2. The sound being MIDI, it left a lot to be desired. I subsequently brought the file into Musescore 4.4.4. The MuseSounds interpretation was a significant improvement over what MSBasic provided. It is important to understand that Musescore is primarily a music notation software, not a digital audio workstation. Since I do want to provide the listener with a reasonably enjoyable experience, I felt it would be best to "write to the software" in terms of dynamics, articulations and so forth. I should think Alice would forgive my little departures from what was on the original manuscript.

Thus, there are discrepancies with that original document.

By the way, presented here is my second publishing of this work, using the Spitfire Symphony Strings, Woodwinds and Brass libraries. I have also updated [my original version](https://musescore.com/user/29275325/scores/22503352) of this piece as newer, better flavours of MuseSounds became available.

This piece is a bit of "Scott Joplin kid brother hanging with Bach's much brighter sister" - well, brighter than Scott Joplin's kid brother, anyway. Not going into more than that. You might hear her influence in the middle bit. Perhaps.

I have found the piano an incredibly versatile instrument - I can readily see why real composers are quite fond of it. This little ditty just tinkles merrily along... something that would be cool to hear being played at those old pianos sitting in airport lobbies.

Hope you enjoy.

### WIPs - Works is a Big Word

For those who might be slightly interested, here's how things like this progress. Taking Alice Mary Smith and her Symphony in C, first movement as my inspiration:

(who, in turn, was inspired by Felix Mendelssohn, another of my absolute favourite composers, ever) this might be a 'Tone Poem' when finished. Or something. Chronicled by date rendered in Reaper:
