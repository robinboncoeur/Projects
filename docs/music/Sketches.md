# Sketching with Notes

## Log

2025-Sep-15:  
I've been re-visiting La Giaconda (Sketch 11). Several 'things' have made that happen: a new *sound* from  Musescore/Musesounds lets me see my music differently. Dare I say: better?  
I'm still writing for the "orchestra" but I do feel like I'm getting a better representation of what the notes on the page would produce played live. Also, most likely due to my mismanagement of uploading, it is no longer in my 'Sketches' list on [my pages](https://musescore.com/robynsveil). To be honest, it's one of my better imaginings, really... just, the orchestration and publishing sucked. I've added brass—horns, and alto and bass trombone—and am going to swap things around a bit better.

## Sketched So Far

All images on this page are originals, created in [ComfyUI](https://www.comfy.org/gallery), in [Flux1](https://flux1ai.com/dev) or some similar model. I do hope they reflect the music to some degree.

### Sketch 15—Waterfall

**2024.Sep.30**

<img src="/assets/images/sketches/Sk15-Waterfall16.jpg" alt="Waterfall" style="float: right; width: 400px;

The film "Portrait de la Jeune Fille en Feu" by Celine Sciamma is living rent-free in my head. All sorts of side stories have emerged: I'm actually even writing a screenplay (which, like most screenplays, will never be seen on a director's chair) and have even engaged ChatGPT4o - I call her Emily - to give me historic perspective for those stories.  
This piece was suggested by those stories. I'm not going to pretend the style is from the 18th century. It doesn't really matter, does it? It's like a Georgette Heyer novel: it's all about where you are transported, if only for a brief moment.  
I hope you enjoy.

25.04.20: ETA... Just to make a point, I'm posting a link here to The Reaper Version, the point being, if your composition plays no faster than this piece, MuseSounds does okay. It's those pesky 1/8th notes and faster, and tuplets and stuff like that which doesn't quite come out right yet, in MuseSounds. I'm confident it will happen, of course, as well as articulation management and other cool stuff.  
25.08.15:ETA... I've invested in the Spitfire Symphonic Strings and Woodwinds for MuseSounds, which, I'm a bit aghast to say, make Reaper and all my high-cost libraries less and less relevant, especially considering what these libraries cost *even on special*. No, Musescore Studio still isn't a DAW, but - like AI - it is rapidly approaching that point.

### Sketch 14—Northwind

**2023.Sep.02**

<img src="/assets/images/sketches/Sk14-Northwind31.jpg" alt="North Wind" style="float: right; width: 400px;
        margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px;" />

I so envy the real composers I follow on MS and elsewhere: they create melodies. Mozart once said something to the tune of "the melody is everything". Yeah, so I don't hear melodies, much. For me, harmonies are a melody. Which makes for weird compositions and strained listening, I know.  
This is why I'm still doing "Sketches": [in Northwind](https://musescore.com/user/29275325/scores/12033163), I've actually-**FINALLY**-sort-of cobbled together a wee melody. The romance period theme is suggested by the another image long ago replaced, an image I generated in ComfyUI. Which this one is, as well.

ETA: although this is probably not the right thing to do - I always seem to do those not-right-to-do things - I simply couldn't leave well-enough alone and changed a few things: whether for the better isn't really my call. Using the vastly-improved MuseSounds instead of the DAW render.  

Thanks for listening.

ETA: I've reviewed this score. I found glaring issues (not all, clearly) which I've corrected. This is a long way from being what I had intended... oh well. The issues appear to 'surface' after exporting to MIDI and importing into a DAW using more sophisticated instrument libraries. It almost feels like my ear had been tricked to believing what I was hearing was 'correct'. I shudder to think what it would sound like, played by an actual ensemble.

### Sketch 13

**2022.Sep.01**  

<img src="/assets/images/sketches/Sk13-Retraite40.jpg" alt="Happy Place" style="float: right; width: 400px;
        margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px;" />

[Debut de la Retraite](https://musescore.com/user/29275325/scores/8516261).  
Some time ago I transcribed from a [hand-written manuscript](https://archive.org/details/GB-Lam_MS1671) a Symphony by a twenty-five year old (at the time) young lady named Alice Mary Smith. Foolishly, I thought I'd try to write from the heart, as she did, which ended up as this "poeme".

In broad strokes, the piece sort-of follows me out the door of post-op recovery to the garden beds and footpath and storm drain and well, hard physical labour. I was going from full-time nursing career to frenetic hard 'yakka', which brought into focus that my health was not optimal. Years of wearing lead and transfering patients had exacted a toll. Despite steps we took to preserve (and improve) what health we enjoyed, which included removing processed foods from the diet (particularly anything with sugar - thank you, Dr Robert Lustig) the years had betrayed me. I let my twenty-five year-old brain dictate utter nonsense to my 70yo body and my back finally gave out. You'll appreciate the point that the injury took place (second timpani roll), subsequently followed by reflection upon ones own mortality. The grandchildren are the fun run-around bit right before the end where I learn to smell the roses.

Hope you enjoy.

Update: I've managed to sort-of do what others have been able to accomplish—at least to some degree—using the YouTube feature: the audio you now hear IS the Reaper version.

BTW, needed to mention: that strange way of writing what amounts to a dotted half-note (3 beats) was to force Musescore to do the note-length sort-of crescendo/decrescendo. As it turned out, the effect wasn't used all that much, but I sort-of left the notation the way I did out of laziness, I suppose. In the case of actually getting this played by actual performers, I'd change it to something more conventional.

### Sketch 12—Chorale

**2023.Jan.15**

<img src="/assets/images/sketches/Sk12-Chorale01.jpg" alt="Melancholy" style="float: right; width: 400px;
        margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px;" />

I agonise over whether to even [publish this Chorale](https://musescore.com/user/29275325/scores/9511855), for a number of reasons. The piece does not reflect the best in solid chord progressions: likely I will post an update at some point as something more fitting - something more what I wanted to say - suggests itself.

But what truly gives me pause is the realisation that what inspired the piece back in October was going to be a red flag for some. Back in October, I realised that what happened on May 24th of last year was going to create a heartache for the affected families on December 25th.

True to form, the media was no longer interested. The public had "moved on". But the heartache those families experienced was very real, to me. As a reasonable "new" grandparent, the precious existence of my children and their children brought the plight of these unfortunate families in Uvalde into sharp focus.

This is not a happy piece. Nor is it completely done. It's one I've struggled with now for some time, and it's actually not done yet. But it's where thing are now. I pray I offend no caring souls with it and hope that I speak for the children.

### Sketch 11—La Gioconda

**2022.Feb.19**

<img src="/assets/images/sketches/Sk11-Giaconda05.jpg" alt="Glee Club" style="float: right; width: 400px;
        margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px;" />

In the Louvre hangs a painting most non-french people think of as Mona Lisa. The French call her [La Joconde](https://musescore.com/user/29275325/scores/7603490) which loosely translated means "jovial", a sentiment which I hoped to convey with this little piece.

Penne Vodka - an actual real composer - has been making awesome suggestions to improve my efforts at orchestration. Spreading out harmonic threads over first and second woodwind instruments added a lot of richness.

I've also been watching the [OrchestrationOnline](https://www.youtube.com/@OrchestrationOnline) courseware on YouTube with Thomas Goss. Interestingly, the deeper I got into the lessons, the more I wondered whatever in the world possessed me to think I could do this! There were aspects that gelled quickly, whereas others left me with a feeling I should probably get back to doing counterpoint or even basic harmony.

Edited to add (2025-Sept-15): I'm revisiting this piece—the recording below is an older one. The published version appears to have disappeared from my site on [Musescore.com](https://musescore.com/robynsveil). The Spitfire Strings and Woodwinds for MuseSounds dynamics are quite different to the standard MuseSounds, so I'm going to have to change articulation tags.

### Sketch 10—Bit Of Fun

**2021.Dec.10**

[Just a bit of fun](https://musescore.com/user/29275325/scores/7247817) for the silly season. I was actually listening to a piece called "Ru Lai Cau Ho" sung by the inimitable Cam Ly - Viet music doesn't stick to twelve tones but sort-of quavers around a fair bit - and this thing grew out of that. No relationship at all... this sounds more like an ethnic dance of some sort.

### Sketch 9—Metaphor of Chooks

**2021.Oct.20**

Some time ago, we decided to do the ethically kind thing and provide a home for six "rescue hens" (measure 1 - 8, noble intentions): chickens that had passed most of their lives in small cages. I fenced in our backyard - eventually - to keep them from destroying our entire property - as chooks do - and gave them a lovely little house to live in, even equipping it with a automatic door to keep out undesirables such as foxes and goanas. When the chooks arrived, they looked a bit worse for wear. However, they quickly adapted (measures 9-17) and found their place in the home we gave them, and in our hearts (measures 18-24). [They ran around](https://musescore.com/user/29275325/scores/7074271), pooed everywhere, scratched every square inch of dirt for bugs, turning their domain into Dunkirk after a shelling.

Bear in mind: they were "rescue hens". They came with co-morbidities, which manifested themselves after a while (measures 25-40) which ultimately ended up with four of them, so far, succumbing to those ailments... and those went the way of all flesh, ultimately (measures 41-48).

### Sketch 8—Reflections

**Uploaded to Musescore on 18th of July, 2021**

Starting off simple, I started reminiscing. About back in the Hawaii, back in France in the 70s... and this sort-of happened. The Andante Moderato was sort-of a nod to my brother, who is the real composer of the family (not me) - he would sit me down and play these lush chords that built and built and well, that was another time. Paris in the 70s... another time. Listening to the Lacrimosa (Mozart) at night and going surfing at barely sunup the next morning and hearing the Lacrimosa in your head as the waves heave and break around you: another time.

As an alternative to listen to, here is the Reaper version. The MS version is sort-of finished, although some bits are a bit less than what I like... perhaps "Amadeus'" Director Orsini-Rosenberg's caution about having "too many notes" might apply here.

Just purchased the [Spitfire Studio Strings](https://www.spitfireaudio.com/spitfire-studio-strings) (because, basically, I could afford it: the [Symphonic Strings](https://www.spitfireaudio.com/spitfire-studio-strings) at $800, actually more like AUD$1278 for me, was a bit too dear) specifically to take advantage of more articulations and, come to find out, although the sound is a fair bit more to my liking, I'm not using a lot of these articulations nearly as much as I thought I would. What I did discover is that what people - those that actually play the notes to record their tracks - use... the mod wheel. This sets up information on cc 01 Mod Wheel MSB in Reaper: plain-ol' drawing in this cc will affect expression and dynamics, which massively changes the quality of the playing. Wow, what a dummy I am! Still learning how to use Kontakt and these libraries and Reaper and Musescore... and just about when I think I'm getting it beaten into submission, they come out with a new version.

### Sketch 7—Souffle des Arbres

**Uploaded to** [Musescore-Sketch VII](https://musescore.com/user/29275325/scores/6784400) **on 22nd-May-2021**

From instruments I've added to my usual list of suspects, one might be able to discern I've been having a long, quite admiring look at Mendelssohn's work of late, most particularly the instrumental opening of the Elijah. Yeah, so a timpani. Actually plunked down a fair bit of change just for a really good library (for Reaper) just for this one instrument.

So, I can say "inspired by" but there the resemblance certainly ends. The tempo never changes... sort-of like wind in the trees, a bit like they're breathing, which the title sort-of means.

Thank you for listening, commenting and having listen to the Reaper version, which I have a much better control over and which I can get to sound the way I want. The Musescore version still isn't what I'm after, sadly, very likely due to ignorance on my part.

ETA: had to re-upload (several times) as I'd sort-of messed up the synthesizer settings. I did try the Symphonic Sounds soundfont, but am not familiar on how to optimise the settings - did change the instruments in Mixer to (I think) the correct ones - and made a royal hash of the sound, so reverted back to the Musescore_General_HQ.sf3 font. Also, thank you for spotting those issues, which I've corrected (and found some others: thought I'd gone over this with a fine-toothed comb).

**Added 19-Nov-2021**

I've had the extreme fortune to be able to obtain the Spitfire Studio Strings and Studio Brass libraries when they were on special and replaced the NI legacy instrument library with these superb libraries in Reaper. I'm not an audiophile but even I can hear the difference. Very, very much looking forward to Musescore 4, where I can avail myself of these libraries. Musescore 4 is so totally going to be a game-changer!

**Update: 2022-Aug-24**

The playback is a Reaper rendition hosted on YouTube. It features SpitFire's Studio Woodwinds, Strings and Brass.

### Sketch 6—Serenade

**Uploaded to** [Musescore-Sketch VI](https://musescore.com/user/29275325/scores/6698255) **on 03th-Apr-2021**

My first transcription in Musescore was Dvorak's String Sextet (the Dumka)... a piece and a composer I have always found bewitching. This serenade is my humble scribblings attempting to emulate this great artist.

Caveat: as always, the first upload on [ 02 Mar 2021 ] was, as far as I could tell, pretty much done, but then, when I imported the MIDI files into Reaper (a DAW), certain flaws surfaced which I had to fix. Which meant that the original score wasn't the final one: revisions happen.

Thank you for listening.

**Update: 03rd-Mar-2021**

I made several suggested changes and have engaged in study of strings fingering. Many, many thanks to Penne Vodka!

**Update: 16th-Oct-2022**

The playback is as produced by my DAW: Reaper. It features SpitFire's Studio Woodwinds and Studio Strings. However, I replaced an oboe section with an English Horn, for which I don't have the sample library in [Studio Woodwinds](https://www.spitfireaudio.com/spitfire-studio-woodwinds#whats-included), so I went with the Library that comes with Kontakt 6. For now. I do intend to upgrade to [Studio Woodwinds Professional](https://www.spitfireaudio.com/spitfire-studio-woodwinds-professional)... specials are coming in November / December!

### Sketch 5

**Uploaded to** [Musescore-Sketch V](https://musescore.com/user/29275325/scores/6609464) **on 13th-Feb-2021**

One of the influential composers in my experience was Alan Hovhaness: perhaps the listener can pick up his minimalist approach to harmony. Oh yeah, a bit of French cinema ambiance here, too. French films have this sound, right? Something I find irresistible.

I so wish that there was a place for WIPs. I'll be polishing this over the next weeks. Don't even know if that's cool.

ETA: there will likely be more tweaks, but overall I'm at a point to call it sort-of done. 

ETA #2: sped it up a bit, remembering the wise counsel of Penne Vodka... and he's right, it DOES sound better. Also, astute listeners - if there are any... this little piece has seen a grand total of 6 pairs of eyeballs - may notice a bit of disparity between the MS score and the Reaper "performance" and may be wondering why I don't reconcile the score to match. Actually, that exercise sort-of doesn't work, because to do so will ultimately make the MS version sound, well, at best meh, at worst, much worse. Until the MS software starts supporting more elaborate sound libraries, the Reaper flavour will always see significant modifications.

### Sketch 4

**Uploaded to** [Musescore-Sketch IV](https://musescore.com/user/29275325/scores/6534804) **on 3rd-Jan-2021**

I had been watching a fair bit of ZeFrank1's "Today we learn about..." botany lessons on YouTube which featured Telemann music in the background, and so, that sort-of got me going. I haven't even a skerrick of Telemann's magic in this little sketch... let's just say it was inspired by.
The title originally had a sort-of footnote: "Still in B minor". Can't seem to get away from B minor, for some reason. Is it an organic thing? do our cells sort-of resonate in a certain key signatures at some point in our lives? Imponderable-ponderables.

BTW, these are all "sketches" for a reason... I'm not pretending or supposing or having any delusion of grandeur that these are compositions. Nope. Just sketches. Like: what happens when you double an oboe with a recorder (sort-of). Or, can a recorder-player actually do this sort of jumping-flea dance? (flute, yeah, but recorder?) So, no, not a composer by any stretch of the imagination.

Maybe, someday.

ETA: I've got real concerns about the range of the recorder. Since the only instrument I ever played reasonably well was the french horn, I've had to learn about other instruments by trial and error. In Musescore, the range for the recorder is probably a bit more liberal than in a DAW: bringing this piece into Reaper left a lot of notes playing silence, so I had to sort-of replace the recorder with the piccolo flute for the time being. Oh, and sped it up again... always playing stuff too slowly.

### Sketch 3

**Uploaded to** [Musescore-Sketch III](https://musescore.com/user/29275325/scores/6534804) **on 21st-Nov-2020**

Nothing serious, just a bit of fun.

Initially, I was thinking "String Quartet" - however, that didn't seem to work... too strident, in the upper strings. However, the sound is a bit more likeable played by the mandolin. Apologies for changing midstream... the characteristics of the melody simply isn't string quartet material.

### Sketch 2

**Uploaded to** [Musescore-Sketch II](https://musescore.com/user/29275325/scores/6534804) **on 30th-Oct-2020**

This piece is a bit of "Scott Joplin kid brother hanging with Bach's much brighter sister" - well, brighter than Scott Joplin's kid brother, anyway. Not going into more than that. You might hear her influence in the middle bit. Perhaps.

I have found the piano an incredibly versatile instrument - I can readily see why real composers are quite fond of it. This little ditty just tinkles merrily along... something that would be cool to hear being played at those old pianos sitting in airport lobbies.

Hope you enjoy.

### Sketch 1

**Uploaded to** [Musescore-Sketch I](https://musescore.com/user/29275325/scores/6534804) **on 6th-Sep-2020**

This "piece", such as it is, sort-of organically grew out of a chord progression I was playing with, which then turned into an exploration of doubling or pairing of instruments... some of which definitely don't work. I don't know that it will ever be a finished piece, but oh well... I'm still learning.

I'm going to have to admit: my rendition in MS is suboptimal. To be honest, what I do in Musescore is truly "sketch it out"... what happens in Reaper is a lot closer to what I'm after, even though it's certainly still quite rough, a lot of it. So, if the listener detects a disparity between what they see in Musescore vs what they hear in Reaper, my apologies in advance... Reaper reflects more what I was trying to do, and to go back to Musescore to reconcile the score with the piece seems like I'm reverse-engineering.

### WIPs - Works is a Big Word

For those who might be slightly interested, here's how things like this progress. Taking Alice Mary Smith and her Symphony in C, first movement as my inspiration:

(who, in turn, was inspired by Felix Mendelssohn, another of my absolute favourite composers, ever) this might be a 'Tone Poem' when finished. Or something. Chronicled by date rendered in Reaper:

Also on offer are [the -ca- score](https://www.tightbytes.com/music/Scores/Sketch13ca.pdf>) and the [Musescore file](https://www.tightbytes.com/music/Scores/Sketch13ca.mscz), such as it is. Whilst I seem to have a sort of ending to the thing, finally, I'm not at all thrilled with a lot of it. Unfortunately, in my current - extremely tedious - workflow, I actually have to export to MIDI and import into Reaper to sort-of hear it properly. Apparently MS 4 will support VST3/VSTis **BUT** here's the thing: no articulations as yet. That'll be 4.1 or so. So, I don't see this workflow changing much for the rest of the year.

Whether this is really a 'tone poem': can't really say. It sort-of smells more like sonata-allegro form, maybe. I might just be hiding behind the "Tone Poem" moniker because, in my very limited experience, that term appears to apply to pieces you can't designate another description.

Voila, [the -cb- (portrait) score](https://www.tightbytes.com/music/Scores/Sketch13cb-pP.pdf), [the -cb- (landscape) score](https://www.tightbytes.com/music/Scores/Sketch13cb-pL.pdf)  and the [MS3 -cb- file](https://www.tightbytes.com/music/Scores/Sketch13cb.mscz).

So, these notes are more me talking to myself than really sharing information with others: just a bit of a caveat.

Some aspects I'm happier with than before: the bit towards the end where the flutes sort-of go a bit ethereal... but this is more getting Reaper to perform what I'd intended in Musescore. Otherwise, there's still a lot of issues.

There's stuff that, as Mozart would have winced at as he tried Salieri's piece on the clavichord - "..this doesn't really work, does it?" Starting in measure 10, that first bang of the timpani: excess to requirement.

But it gets worse.

A real quandary lies in measures 15 through 19... this is the 4th attempt at a reasonable - but questionable - segway into what follows. So, re-thinking this. It's just doesn't flow right. It actually sounds better in MS3 than Reaper. Reaper is the acid test as to whether this works, though.

I actually feel bad for the timpani player: wanted to give him a bit more to do, but those are the only spots that seem indicated.

And I feel bad for the brass section.

In this sort of piece - using Alice Mary Smith's First Movement of her C-minor symphony as an example, she explores a few melodic ideas with her horns - I have transcribed her first movement into Musescore and hope to post it soon - but it seems a lot of what she does is have them sort-of provide harmonic overtones, which I tried to do in measures 26 through 31 (and the repeat). And I'm not keen on the result: the poor french horn player has to play fairly softly - never an easy thing for the french horn in the higher registers - and so it doesn't sound at all realistic. But what I find more unacceptable is **what** he actually plays... it's just: meh. So, do I take it out or try something a bit cleverer... same with the tuba. I'm asking these players to fill a supporting role, but they tend to stand out a bit more than I'd like.

By the way, I can't seem to get MS to include the full score in Landscape mode into a PDF. That's a fail. Maybe I need to selet a larger paper format, perhaps? Tried ledger-sized paper: seems to work.

**Update A**

It's now almost two in the arvo, been up since 4am. A few things occur to me: I used to write to the sound produced in Musescore. Writing to Reaper seems similar, although the generated piece has a fair bit more life to it... dynamics, and all that.

Still more to do to the end of the thing. Sort-of just ends... legitimately, but almost, a non-event.



**Update B**

It's now quarter-past nine in the evening. I think I've reached a stopping point.

It's not done. Closer, though. At least, it doesn't sort-of just end.

**Update C**

Saturday afternoon. Found the missing solution, perhaps, to some of the lines in this piece that "simply don't really work"... that is: it will be worth my while to study a bit of counterpoint.

I've actually subscribed to [Ryan Leach's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/RyanLeach) - reckon it would be worth it to sign up for his course as well. It would go a long way to clearing up some of the muddiness I create - involuntarily - and explain why sometimes the magic works, whilse often it doesn't.


**Programme Notes**

Transcribing from manuscript Alice Mary Smith's bold Symphony in C (bold for even an accomplished musician and composer as she was given the world she lived in and her age) has been a stimulus to write again, sort-of following my instincts - never a particularly wise thing to do - and write from the heart. I've hit 70, finally retired from 40-odd years of nursing with a bad back to show for it. This gave me time to write this "poeme".

In broad strokes, the piece sort-of follows me out tthe door of post-op recovery to the garden beds, going from full-time caring for post-op patients to frenetic hard 'yakka' about and around the house, which brought into focus that my health was not optimal. Steps we took included removing processed foods from the diet (particularly anything with sugar) and "light exercise". However, I did let my twenty-five year-old brain dictate utter nonsense to my 70-y-o body and my back finally gave out. You'll appreciate the point that the injury took place (second timpani roll), subsequently followed by reflection upon ones own mortality. The grandchildren are the fun run-around bit right before the end.

I'm sort-of doing this back-to-front: two non-music-related tutorials to finish - one being the Harvard Computer Science Online course (CS50 2021) - and then, a deep-dive into Ryan Leach's composition tutorials! Perhaps that will pick up my game a bit.

**Update: 2022-Aug-24**

The playback is now the Reaper version on my Musescore site, thanks to YouTube. It features SpitFire Studio Woodwinds and Studio Strings - the least expensive versions for now, as I really am only beginning to get my head around Reaper and sound libraries and articulations and instrument ranges and composition in general. The sound: well, significantly more what I wanted it to be.

I recently purchased the Spitfire Studio Brass library (for Reaper) and wow, what a lot of fun.


**Update: 2022-Sep-01**

Have only just barely started Ryan's course - got stuck into Marc Sabatella's course on Musescore, the whole enchillada (learned a lot, too!) - but also watched a quick video he did on pieces that failed to make the cut in his composition, and why. Which made me re-examine some of the weak spots in "Poeme".... there are several. Also, spiffed up the score itself... reloading onto the site.

**Update: 2023-01-08**

Currently trying to get a "Chorale" right - also struggling with harmonies - that is far less light-hearted. Not sure I'd ever put it on Musescore.com: it's fraught with unhappy messages that might invoke controversy.

**Update: 2023-02-27**

The .reabanks for Spitfire Studio Woodwinds had flaws: they have been fixed and the updates uploaded to the Reaper forum and the Reaticulate github page. The Spitfire Studio Brass (Standard and Professional) are also done and uploaded to both sites.

And I've made a start on the Strings: the Base, Core Techniques and Legato patches for Standard are done and work.

Practising my violin: this is definitely uphill work. The bow wants to chatter and involve more than on string at a time: typical "gremmy" stuff. Good job I got the mute for it!

## My Violin Adventure

I have a section The Violin - on the **All Repairs** page that sort-of covers more of the nitty-gritty of costs, progress in terms of fixing up the violins, etc: so I won't rehash that here. I'll jst say that of the first of February, 2023, I now own three (3) violings, all student-grade, in various states of (dis)repair.

My go-to place for things violin is [SimplyForStrings](https://www.simplyforstrings.com.au/) in Red Hill, QLD. On 31/01/2023, Michael actually examined that second violin - the one made in Czechoslovakia - to see if the pegs needed urgently changing: they are worn, but he reckons they're okay for now. He kindly showed me how to replace a string correctly. I hope to be taking their 'Violin Maintenance" class when they next hold it.



### My First Real Violin

**14th of March, 2023**

I went to Red Hill to [Simply for Strings](https://www.simplyforstrings.com.au/) today to have a sticky-beak. The ad on their site suggested that the Gliga Vasile Professional had the sound I was after: rich and nicely textured, more of a second violin / orchestral support instrument, which was indeed what I was after.

Rhys selected three of the Gliga... at different price-points and of course, quality of wood, etc. The first was the [Gliga III ($790)](https://www.simplyforstrings.com.au/products/gliga-iii-violin-outfit-4-4). Nice, especially when in the hands of Rhys: wow! I'm glad I didn't have to expose my feeble efforts at bow-bouncing and sawing at the e-string. 

Then, he played the the [Gliga II ($970)](https://www.simplyforstrings.com.au/products/gliga-ii-violin-outfit-with-dark-antique-varnish-4-4). Beautiful, rich, just what I wanted to ultimately be playing. And finally, the one I came to see: the [Gliga Vasile Professional](https://www.simplyforstrings.com.au/products/gliga-vasile-professional-series-violin-dark-antique-model-4-4). All three are considered either intermediate or advanced student violins. So, we're past the sub-$500 stuff now: definitely real violins.

Interestingly, it was the Gliga II that appealed to me the most, and it was the one I ended up purchasing.



### I Can Dream, Right?

**16th of March, 2023**

Multiple sources all assert the same: violin-playing is hard. The key to learning is persistence. Having a new, lovely instrument is making the learning process so much more appealing, but there's no doubt that it's going to be slow going. I have yet to place fingers on the strings: all open-string exercises, so far. And yet, the dreams of playing Bach Sonatas and Inventions remain alive and vibrant in my imagination.

Practise currently consists of short, 10 - 15 minute sessions. I'm trying to focus on a relaxed bow-balance (vs. bow-hold) and a clear sound, more than accurate playing, for the time being. And it is very slowly improving, but very, very slowly. With setbacks. I really need an instructor.

In the meantime, I [dream](https://www.simplyforstrings.com.au/products/pierre-marcel-deluxe-violin-stradivarius-model-1710-belgium) ... and [dream some more](https://www.simplyforstrings.com.au/products/jacques-leclerc-violin-c-1925).

## Musescore Composers Suggestions

Good on ya, mate. I noticed you have a classical approach to material and rhythm (which is fine). There is a baroque-ish type intensity with those busy 16th note patterns against the monolithic chords. I know that you are taking a step by step approach to orchestrating. With that said I think you'll find better blends when you pair your winds.

From your arrangements I think you'll know how. After all, there are many composer styles to look into - as long as you match it with your material. For example, (assuming you still want this type of input) in this style there is straight-forward doubling. You have ended up with several simultaneous bass lines (between Cb, vc, trbn, bsn) in several places. The uniformity of bass line at m 26 sounds more solid, though you do not need the vla on that line.

The stylistic solution would be divide into 4 parts:

- Fl,Ob, Cl, Bsn 	
- double 	
- Vln 1, Vln2, Cla and CB/VC. 
	
You can reinforce certain lines intermittently with brass (as you did in m29 etc). This would result in "clarity of line", important especially in this style. You have done well to break up the texture now and then. By the way, all recommend - including [Thomas Goss, an online favorite of many](https://orchestrationonline.com/bio/) - to not have a key signature with horns in F. Usually the horns and trumpets, cornets do not have a key signature.

I've been away a while and now I'm getting caught up. I put some new NP renditions up which might support your opinion of NP. I've heard they're waffling a bit on NP support, or it may come later than sooner. Don't know.

Good work.
