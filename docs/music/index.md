# Introduction

I sort-of don't really see my little efforts as real "compositions". And although some are sort-of done, is a piece ever truly *finished*?

Welcome to my little musical sketches, in reverse chronological order, except for Sketch12, which I wrote after Sketch13. I wrote these to sort-of get an idea how instruments interact, and what they do at different points of the register. For example, a trumpet playing in a higher register is going to have a completely different effect than one playing in the lower registers.

Also, asking a trumpet player to play softly in a higher register is going to be met with some raised left eyebrows and twitching upper lips. This brings up what we can do in a DAW / music notation software versus reality: sure, you can dial down the trumpet playing a high C, but it's not going to sound very realistic.
