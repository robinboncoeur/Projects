Liver Cleansing

I'd actually started tracking my weight back in November, when I was 113.35 kg (almost 250lbs). Did a dry November which extended into December, had a bit of wine over the holidays and particularly when I retired the first part of January. Julia and I visited some of her Rural Aid volunteers in Eumundi the second weekend in January, after which I stopped all consumption of any fermented (alcoholic) beverages.

The point here wasn't weight loss: that was going to be incidental. The focus was on liver-cleansing.

In February, I started a spreadsheet in Excel to track my progress. Here's the first month, February:

At this point, we'd cut back on bread but were still having starch in the form of roast potatoes and sweet potatoes. Towards the end of February, we stopped all those starches as well. Here's March:

Progress was slow on the weight-loss front. Lots of aches and pains, particularly in the back. And then, Julia went to Orroroo. We both stayed faithful to the plan. Here's April so far:

Went for a 3k walk on the Jack Gordon path along the water at Redland Bay. Here's the start... that's my little 2014 Hyundai i20. Still in pretty good nick for a 8 year-old car. The weather was perfect for walking:

and along the water

Then for a 5k bike ride. Gotta start somewhere... better than sitting all day.

Takeaways:

	1. Four basic causes for this neurological degenerative process
		a. Anything that causes ongoing inflammation (pathogens / leaky gut / poor oral microbiome)
		b. Anything thst is toxic (organic or inorganic toxins)
		c. Energetics (must support the brain, including oxygenation, mitochondrial function, ketones)
		d. Trophic support (regenerative growth: exercise, B vitamins)

	2. Eight subcellular pathologies contributing to chronic disease
		a. glycation
		b. oxidative stress (reactive oxygen species)
		c. mitochondrial dysfunction
		d. insulin resistance
		e. membrane instability
		f. inflammation
		g. methylation
		h. autophagy
		
	3. Insulin resistance contributes to all four pathogical processes
		a. inflammation due to non-enzymatic glycation of protein
		b. insulin resistance-related toxicity
		c. trophic processes (brain cell regeneration) *requires* insulin: neurons need insulin as a growth factor, pathology which goes from synapto-plastic state (making new neurons) to a synapto-clastic state (protective signalling driving amyloid-precursor proteins, which is part of the protective mechanism / innate immune response)

Food Tips

***Add Garlic Last**

If you enjoy trying new dishes with bold, delicious flavors, you might have noticed a pattern: recipes rarely tell you to toss garlic in a dish first. But why is that?

Garlic is almost always added after you’ve begun cooking other aromatics, like celery and carrots, to prevent it from overcooking or burning.

Those who have cooked with minced garlic before are likely well aware that it burns incredibly fast. Unlike onions, which get a delicious caramelization effect as they cook, overcooked garlic is acrid and not the most savory flavor. Adding garlic after you sauté other ingredients can help prevent that burnt flavor from invading your recipe.

Unlike onions and other aromatics, garlic has less water content which is why it’s so prone to burn. When you start your dish with an ingredient like onions, they release water into the pan. By creating that layer in the pan and then adding garlic, you’ll help prevent burning.

Worried about if cooking your garlic later will mean less garlic flavor? Don’t be. In a test done by Serious Eats, garlic was added to a pan at the same time as onions in one dish, and in another dish, the onions were sauteed first with garlic added second. Turns out, adding garlic to a recipe later actually results in more garlic flavor, not less.

The next time you’re tempted to add your garlic first because you think it’ll boost flavor, think again.
