Liver Cleansing

====================
Weight-loss Tracking
====================

I'd actually started tracking my weight back in November, when I was 113.35 kg (almost 250lbs). Did a dry November which extended into December, had a bit of wine over the holidays and particularly when I retired the first part of January. Julia and I visited some of her Rural Aid volunteers in Eumundi the second weekend in January, after which I stopped all consumption of any fermented (alcoholic) beverages.

The point here wasn't weight loss: that was going to be incidental. The focus was on liver-cleansing.

In February, I started a spreadsheet in Excel to track my progress. Here's the first month, February:

At this point, we'd cut back on bread but were still having starch in the form of roast potatoes and sweet potatoes. Towards the end of February, we stopped all those starches as well. Here's March:

Progress was slow on the weight-loss front. Lots of aches and pains, particularly in the back. And then, Julia went to Orroroo. We both stayed faithful to the plan:

...for the most part. However, there were "breaks from the action", like days we had fish-n-chips, or kebabs. High in sodium... you can tell from the spikes when this happened:

Overall, it **has** been pretty steady (on average). Here's June so far:

=======================
And then, this happened
=======================

Here's a few observations on events that have happened the past few days. First, though, core concepts that I hold as uncontestable:

	We are created beings: thus, we have a creator. He would not recommend anything that would negatively affect our health, mental or physical.
	The world is in decline: what we ingest and our environment is growing increasingly toxic. Which calls for prudence / thoughtfulness / situational awareness.
	Science must be respected, but not revered (i.e., considered gospel). It is not the ultimate truth: though it generally represents the closest thing we have to what we can confirm to be true, based on observation (which is different to faith-based truths).

I have been stepping on the scale every morning upon rising. I know: you're not meant to do that, but it actually tells me a lot. Sudden weight gain or loss - to me, at least - points to fluid retention or loss: one doesn't accumulate (or lose) adipose rapidly.

So, I ask myself: what causes fluid retention? Lustig indicates in one of his discussions that this can be a result of inflammation. Well, there's no question I still have significant inflammation, which very recently expressed itself as severe gout (uric acid production = unhappy liver) in the right foot and tenderness in the left knee. For which I finally took Advil and Tylenol and subsequently went from 96.8 to 99.1kg in a matter of days. Both of those meds are hepatotoxic: that I know. The liver deals with toxins: that we know.

That I should have that profound a response (a 2kg fluid weight gain!) tells me a fair bit about the state of my liver, and sets at question what Lustig said about rapid liver function recovery: apparently restoring a liver back to normal is a longer process than he thought.

In this episode of Bulletproof Radio, Robert H. Lustig, M.D., M.S.L., the New York Times bestselling author of several books about the problems caused by sugar, processed food and the health conditions of obesity, shares his expertise and research about metabolic health.

He addresses nutrition, food science, and global health, and explains how by focusing on real food we can reverse chronic disease and promote longevity. He also challenges the current healthcare paradigm and the influence of Big Food, Big Pharma, and Big Government.

Dr. Lustig is a pediatric neuroendocrinologist who’s spent his forty-plus year career treating and finding ways to prevent obesity and diabetes. He’s emeritus professor of pediatrics in the Division of Endocrinology and member of the Institute for Health Policy Studies at the University of California, San Francisco.

He’s authored one-hundred thirty peer-reviewed articles, eighty academic chapters and reviews, and dozens of op-eds for the public. He now has a new book to explain the eight pathologies that underlie all chronic disease and document how processed food has impacted our health, economy, and environment over the past fifty years. - Dave Asprey

Takeaways:

	1. Four basic causes for this neurological degenerative process
		a. Anything that causes ongoing inflammation (pathogens / leaky gut / poor oral microbiome)
		b. Anything thst is toxic (organic or inorganic toxins)
		c. Energetics (must support the brain, including oxygenation, mitochondrial function, ketones)
		d. Trophic support (regenerative growth: exercise, B vitamins)

	2. Eight subcellular pathologies contributing to chronic disease
		a. glycation
		b. oxidative stress (reactive oxygen species)
		c. mitochondrial dysfunction
		d. insulin resistance
		e. membrane instability
		f. inflammation
		g. methylation
		h. autophagy
		
	3. Insulin resistance contributes to all four pathogical processes
		a. inflammation due to non-enzymatic glycation of protein
		b. insulin resistance-related toxicity
		c. trophic processes (brain cell regeneration) *requires* insulin: neurons need insulin as a growth factor, pathology which goes from synapto-plastic state (making new neurons) to a synapto-clastic state (protective signalling driving amyloid-precursor proteins, which is part of the protective mechanism / innate immune response)

Food Tips
=========

***Add Garlic Last**

If you enjoy trying new dishes with bold, delicious flavors, you might have noticed a pattern: recipes rarely tell you to toss garlic in a dish first. But why is that?

Garlic is almost always added after you’ve begun cooking other aromatics, like celery and carrots, to prevent it from overcooking or burning.

Those who have cooked with minced garlic before are likely well aware that it burns incredibly fast. Unlike onions, which get a delicious caramelization effect as they cook, overcooked garlic is acrid and not the most savory flavor. Adding garlic after you sauté other ingredients can help prevent that burnt flavor from invading your recipe.

Unlike onions and other aromatics, garlic has less water content which is why it’s so prone to burn. When you start your dish with an ingredient like onions, they release water into the pan. By creating that layer in the pan and then adding garlic, you’ll help prevent burning.

Worried about if cooking your garlic later will mean less garlic flavor? Don’t be. In a test done by Serious Eats, garlic was added to a pan at the same time as onions in one dish, and in another dish, the onions were sauteed first with garlic added second. Turns out, adding garlic to a recipe later actually results in more garlic flavor, not less.

The next time you’re tempted to add your garlic first because you think it’ll boost flavor, think again.

Food Challenges
===============

Wonder why counting calories doesn't work? Maybe because 'a calorie is NOT a calorie'?
Here's why:
a. It's not what you eat, it's what you absorb.
b. It's not what you absorb, it's what you metabolize.
c. It's not what you metabolize, but how much ATP you make.
d. It's not what you exercise, it's what you burn.
e. It's not what you burn, it's how many ATP vs. heat your mitochondria partition, both at rest and during exercise.
You think you can count those? If so, I've got a bridge to sell you....
