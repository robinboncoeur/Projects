Below are links to musical sketches, in reverse chronological order. I wrote these to sort-of get an idea how instruments interact, and what they do at different points of the register. For example, a trumpet playing in a higher register is going to have a completely different effect than one playing in the lower registers.

Also, asking a trumpet player to play softly in a higher register is going to be met with some raised left eyebrows and twitching upper lips. This brings up what we can do in a DAW / music notation software versus reality: sure, you can dial down the trumpet playing a high C, but it's not going to sound very realistic.

Sketch 11 - 'La Gioconda'
=========================

**2022.Feb.19**

In the Louvre hangs a painting most non-french people think of as Mona Lisa. The French call her `La Joconde <https://musescore.com/user/29275325/scores/7603490>`_ which loosely translated means "jovial", a sentiment which I hoped to convey with this little piece. Having first and second woodwinds really did add a lot of richness to the sound: Penne Vodka - an actual real composer - has been making awesome suggestions to improve my efforts at orchestration. I am watching the OrchestrationOnline courseware on YouTube with Thomas Goss: the deeper I get into the tutorial, the more I wonder whatever in the world possessed me to think I could do this!

Sketch 10
=========

**2021.Dec.10**

`Just a bit of fun <https://musescore.com/user/29275325/scores/7247817>`_ for the silly season. I was actually listening to a piece called "Ru Lai Cau Ho" sung by the inimitable Cam Ly - Viet music doesn't stick to twelve tones but sort-of quavers around a fair bit - and this thing grew out of that. No relationship at all... this sounds more like an ethnic dance of some sort.

Sketch 9 - 'A Metaphor of Chooks'
=================================

**2021.Oct.20**

Some time ago, we decided to do the ethically kind thing and provide a home for six "rescue hens" (measure 1 - 8, noble intentions): chickens that had passed most of their lives in small cages. I fenced in our backyard - eventually - to keep them from destroying our entire property - as chooks do - and gave them a lovely little house to live in, even equipping it with a automatic door to keep out undesirables such as foxes and goanas. When the chooks arrived, they looked a bit worse for wear. However, they quickly adapted (measures 9-17) and found their place in the home we gave them, and in our hearts (measures 18-24). `They ran around <https://musescore.com/user/29275325/scores/7074271>`_, pooed everywhere, scratched every square inch of dirt for bugs, turning their domain into Dunkirk after a shelling.

Bear in mind: they were "rescue hens". They came with co-morbidities, which manifested themselves after a while (measures 25-40) which ultimately ended up with four of them, so far, succumbing to those ailments... and those went the way of all flesh, ultimately (measures 41-48).
