Finished Sketches - Sort-Of
***************************

Um, end of the day, these aren't really "compositions". And although some are sort-of done, is a piece ever truly 'finished'?

Below are links to musical sketches, in reverse chronological order. I wrote these to sort-of get an idea how instruments interact, and what they do at different points of the register. For example, a trumpet playing in a higher register is going to have a completely different effect than one playing in the lower registers.

Also, asking a trumpet player to play softly in a higher register is going to be met with some raised left eyebrows and twitching upper lips. This brings up what we can do in a DAW / music notation software versus reality: sure, you can dial down the trumpet playing a high C, but it's not going to sound very realistic.

Sketch 13
=========

**2022.Sep.01**

Some time ago I transcribed from a `hand-written manuscript <https://archive.org/details/GB-Lam_MS1671>`_ a Symphony by a twenty-five year old (at the time) young lady named Alice Mary Smith. Foolishly, I thought I'd try to write from the heart, as she did, which ended up as this "poeme".

The piece sort-of runs blithely away from a career of nursing to gardening and fixing footpaths and stormdrains and other projects. Years of wearing lead (x-rays) and transfering patients had affected my back, which finally gave out (second timpani roll): the injury has provided the opportunity to re-evaluate what was most important and learned to smell the roses.

Sketch 11 - 'La Gioconda'
=========================

**2022.Feb.19**

In the Louvre hangs a painting most non-french people think of as Mona Lisa. The French call her `La Joconde <https://musescore.com/user/29275325/scores/7603490>`_ which loosely translated means "jovial", a sentiment which I hoped to convey with this little piece. Having first and second woodwinds really did add a lot of richness to the sound: Penne Vodka - an actual real composer - has been making awesome suggestions to improve my efforts at orchestration. I am watching the OrchestrationOnline courseware on YouTube with Thomas Goss: the deeper I get into the tutorial, the more I wonder whatever in the world possessed me to think I could do this!

=========

**2021.Dec.10**

`Just a bit of fun <https://musescore.com/user/29275325/scores/7247817>`_ for the silly season. I was actually listening to a piece called "Ru Lai Cau Ho" sung by the inimitable Cam Ly - Viet music doesn't stick to twelve tones but sort-of quavers around a fair bit - and this thing grew out of that. No relationship at all... this sounds more like an ethnic dance of some sort.

Sketch 9 - 'A Metaphor of Chooks'
=================================

**2021.Oct.20**

Some time ago, we decided to do the ethically kind thing and provide a home for six "rescue hens" (measure 1 - 8, noble intentions): chickens that had passed most of their lives in small cages. I fenced in our backyard - eventually - to keep them from destroying our entire property - as chooks do - and gave them a lovely little house to live in, even equipping it with a automatic door to keep out undesirables such as foxes and goanas. When the chooks arrived, they looked a bit worse for wear. However, they quickly adapted (measures 9-17) and found their place in the home we gave them, and in our hearts (measures 18-24). `They ran around <https://musescore.com/user/29275325/scores/7074271>`_, pooed everywhere, scratched every square inch of dirt for bugs, turning their domain into Dunkirk after a shelling.

Bear in mind: they were "rescue hens". They came with co-morbidities, which manifested themselves after a while (measures 25-40) which ultimately ended up with four of them, so far, succumbing to those ailments... and those went the way of all flesh, ultimately (measures 41-48).

Sketch 8 - 'Reflections'
========================

**Uploaded to Musescore on 18th of July, 2021**

Starting off simple, I started reminiscing. About back in the Hawaii, back in France in the 70s... and this sort-of happened. The Andante Moderato was sort-of a nod to my brother, who is the real composer of the family (not me) - he would sit me down and play these lush chords that built and built and well, that was another time. Paris in the 70s... another time. Listening to the Lacrimosa (Mozart) at night and going surfing at barely sunup the next morning and hearing the Lacrimosa in your head as the waves heave and break around you: another time.

As an alternative to listen to, here is the Reaper version. The MS version is sort-of finished, although some bits are a bit less than what I like... perhaps "Amadeus'" Director Orsini-Rosenberg's caution about having "too many notes" might apply here.

Just purchased the `Spitfire Studio Strings <https://www.spitfireaudio.com/spitfire-studio-strings>`_ (because, basically, I could afford this: the `Symphonic Strings <https://www.spitfireaudio.com/spitfire-studio-strings>`_ at $800, actually more like AUD$1278 for me, was a bit too dear) specifically to take advantage of more articulations and, come to find out, although the sound is a fair bit more to my liking, I'm not using a lot of these articulations nearly as much as I thought I would. What I did discover is that what people - those that actually play the notes to record their tracks - use... the mod wheel. This sets up information on cc 01 Mod Wheel MSB in Reaper: plain-ol' drawing in this cc will affect expression and dynamics, which massively changes the quality of the playing. Wow, what a dummy I am! Still learning how to use Kontakt and these libraries and Reaper and Musescore... and just about when I think I'm getting it beaten into submission, they come out with a new version.

Sketch 6 - Serenade
===================

**Uploaded to** `Musescore.com <https://musescore.com/user/29275325/scores/6698255>`_ **on 03th-Apr-2021**

My first transcription in Musescore was Dvorak's String Sextet (the Dumka)... a piece and a composer I have always found bewitching. This serenade is my humble scribblings attempting to emulate this great artist.

Caveat: as always, the first upload on [ 02 Mar 2021 ] was, as far as I could tell, pretty much done, but then, when I imported the MIDI files into Reaper (a DAW), certain flaws surfaced which I had to fix. Which meant that the original score wasn't the final one: revisions happen.

Thank you for listening.

**Update: 03rd-Mar-2021**

I made several suggested changes and have engaged in study of strings fingering. Many, many thanks to Penne Vodka!

**Update: 16th-Oct-2022**

The playback is as produced by my DAW: Reaper. It features SpitFire's Studio Woodwinds and Studio Strings. However, I replaced an oboe section with an English Horn, for which I don't have the sample library in `Studio Woodwinds <https://www.spitfireaudio.com/spitfire-studio-woodwinds#whats-included>`_, so I went with the Library that comes with Kontakt 6. For now. I do intend to upgrade to `Studio Woodwinds Professional <https://www.spitfireaudio.com/spitfire-studio-woodwinds-professional>`_... specials are coming in November / December!

WIPs - Works is a Big Word

For those who might be slightly interested, here's how things like this progress. Taking Alice Mary Smith and her Symphony in C, first movement as my inspiration:

(who, in turn, was inspired by Felix Mendelssohn, another of my absolute favourite composers, ever) this might be a 'Tone Poem' when finished. Or something. Chronicled by date rendered in Reaper:

Whilst I seem to have a sort of ending to the thing, finally, I'm not at all thrilled with a lot of it. Unfortunately, in my current - extremely tedious - workflow, I actually have to export to MIDI and import into Reaper to sort-of hear it properly. Apparently MS 4 will support VST3/VSTis **BUT** here's the thing: no articulations as yet. That'll be 4.1 or so. So, I don't see this workflow changing much for the rest of the year.

Whether this is really a 'tone poem': can't really say. It sort-of smells more like sonata-allegro form, maybe. I might just be hiding behind the "Tone Poem" moniker because, in my very limited experience, that term appears to apply to pieces you can't designate another description.

Voila, `the -cb- (portrait) score <https://www.tightbytes.com/music/Scores/Sketch13cb-pP.pdf>`_, `the -cb- (landscape) score <https://www.tightbytes.com/music/Scores/Sketch13cb-pL.pdf>`_  and the `MS3 -cb- file <https://www.tightbytes.com/music/Scores/Sketch13cb.mscz>`_. 

So, these notes are more me talking to myself than really sharing information with others: just a bit of a caveat.

Some aspects I'm happier with than before: the bit towards the end where the flutes sort-of go a bit ethereal... but this is more getting Reaper to perform what I'd intended in Musescore. Otherwise, there's still a lot of issues.

There's stuff that, as Mozart would have winced at as he tried Salieri's piece on the clavichord - "..this doesn't really work, does it?" Starting in measure 10, that first bang of the timpani: excess to requirement.

But it gets worse.

A real quandary lies in measures 15 through 19... this is the 4th attempt at a reasonable - but questionable - segway into what follows. So, re-thinking this. It's just doesn't flow right. It actually sounds better in MS3 than Reaper. Reaper is the acid test as to whether this works, though.

I actually feel bad for the timpani player: wanted to give him a bit more to do, but those are the only spots that seem indicated.

And I feel bad for the brass section.

In this sort of piece - using Alice Mary Smith's First Movement of her C-minor symphony as an example, she explores a few melodic ideas with her horns - I have transcribed her first movement into Musescore and hope to post it soon - but it seems a lot of what she does is have them sort-of provide harmonic overtones, which I tried to do in measures 26 through 31 (and the repeat). And I'm not keen on the result: the poor french horn player has to play fairly softly - never an easy thing for the french horn in the higher registers - and so it doesn't sound at all realistic. But what I find more unacceptable is **what** he actually plays... it's just: meh. So, do I take it out or try something a bit cleverer... same with the tuba. I'm asking these players to fill a supporting role, but they tend to stand out a bit more than I'd like.

By the way, I can't seem to get MS to include the full score in Landscape mode into a PDF. That's a fail. Maybe I need to selet a larger paper format, perhaps? Tried ledger-sized paper: seems to work.

**Update A**

It's now almost two in the arvo, been up since 4am. A few things occur to me: I used to write to the sound produced in Musescore. Writing to Reaper seems similar, although the generated piece has a fair bit more life to it... dynamics, and all that.

Still more to do to the end of the thing. Sort-of just ends... legitimately, but almost, a non-event.

It's not done. Closer, though. At least, it doesn't sort-of just end.

**Update C**

Saturday afternoon. Found the missing solution, perhaps, to some of the lines in this piece that "simply don't really work"... that is: it will be worth my while to study a bit of counterpoint.

I've actually subscribed to `Ryan Leach's YouTube channel <https://www.youtube.com/c/RyanLeach>`_ - reckon it would be worth it to sign up for his course as well. It would go a long way to clearing up some of the muddiness I create - involuntarily - and explain why sometimes the magic works, whilse often it doesn't.


**Programme Notes**

Transcribing from manuscript Alice Mary Smith's bold Symphony in C (bold for even an accomplished musician and composer as she was given the world she lived in and her age) has been a stimulus to write again, sort-of following my instincts - never a particularly wise thing to do - and write from the heart. I've hit 70, finally retired from 40-odd years of nursing with a bad back to show for it. This gave me time to write this "poeme".

In broad strokes, the piece sort-of follows me out tthe door of post-op recovery to the garden beds, going from full-time caring for post-op patients to frenetic hard 'yakka' about and around the house, which brought into focus that my health was not optimal. Steps we took included removing processed foods from the diet (particularly anything with sugar) and "light exercise". However, I did let my twenty-five year-old brain dictate utter nonsense to my 70-y-o body and my back finally gave out. You'll appreciate the point that the injury took place (second timpani roll), subsequently followed by reflection upon ones own mortality. The grandchildren are the fun run-around bit right before the end.

I'm sort-of doing this back-to-front: two non-music-related tutorials to finish - one being the Harvard Computer Science Online course (CS50 2021) - and then, a deep-dive into Ryan Leach's composition tutorials! Perhaps that will pick up my game a bit.

Hope you enjoy.

**Update: 2022-Aug-24**

The playback is now the Reaper version on my Musescore site, thanks to YouTube. It features SpitFire Studio Woodwinds and Studio Strings - the least expensive versions for now, as I really am only beginning to get my head around Reaper and sound libraries and articulations and instrument ranges and composition in general. The sound: well, significantly more what I wanted it to be.

I recently purchased the Spitfire Studio Brass library (for Reaper) and wow, what a lot of fun.


**Update: 2022-Sep-01**

Have only just barely started Ryan's course - got stuck into Marc Sabatella's course on Musescore, the whole enchillada (learned a lot, too!) - but also watched a quick video he did on pieces that failed to make the cut in his composition, and why. Which made me re-examine some of the weak spots in "Poeme".... there are several. Also, spiffed up the score itself... reloading onto the site.
