In the Louvre hangs a painting most non-french people think of as Mona Lisa. The French call her "La Joconde", which loosely translated means "jovial". A sentiment which, loosely interpreted, I hoped to convey with this little piece. Having first and second woodwinds really did add a lot of richness to the sound: Penne Vodka put me on to something quite interesting. Am watching the OrchestrationOnline courseware on YouTube with Thomas Goss, and wonder what possesses me to think I can do this! LOL

So, I *am* investing in NotePerformer. However, there really isn't much advantage to investing in Dorico as well, as the workflow into that app is no less labour-intensive to getting it into Reaper. I'll stay with Musescore and hopefully a future version will provide support for NotePerformer. Too keen on Reaper to go down another DAW rabbit-hole.
