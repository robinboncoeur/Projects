My Projects Pages 
*****************

I was trying to upload images to a GMail email I was sending to Martin and Esther on 2022-Apr-15. Got about halfway through and GMail told me I would exceeded the size limit (25mb). Which seems silly. And this is without trying to send a video, even. Just pictures.

What appeals to me about doing project progress sharing this way is:

	* I can share a LOT of information no-cost
	
	* The information is hidden in obscurity of "no-one gives a rat's nether-regions about what I'm doing". *Just have a look at `Tightbytes <https://www.tightbytes.com/>`_. Visitors? none*. 
	
	* Updating is a lot quicker on GitHub than on Tightbytes: I edit locally, then use Github Desktop to manage the update to my pages.
	
You will notice that dates sort-of from the link key. For example, I'll give whoever I'm writing an email to, as a link, the current entry into a give project page, like so::

	https://robinboncoeur.github.io/Projects/RSTs/Garden.html#apr-23
	
Sphinx is really good that way! By the way, the images have been uniformly resized (for the most part) to 1024 x 768 pixels. They are not displayed in that resolution, but right-clicking and choosing "Open image in a New Tab..." will display that image in full resolution. 



.. raw:: html
   
   <hr style="height:4px;border-width:0;color:gray;background-color:gray">





*************************************
Reminders [to Myself] of Sphinx Stuff
*************************************

=============
Inline images
=============

For externally-stored images (most will be stored on Tightbytes, for my pages)::

	* .. image:: http://www.tightbytes.com/Music/CReinecke/CReinecke1890.jpg

and for those stored with the data files::

	* .. image:: ../images/blAltRtClick01.png



======================
Embedded YouTube Video
======================

This code::

.. raw:: html
   
   <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/123xxxXXXyZ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

   <hr style="height:4px;border-width:0;color:gray;background-color:gray">

Should have 11 characters::

	3LbsmS5TJXA
	123xxxXXXyZ

Key to note is the difference in the link in the raw html syntax vs the actual youtube link::

	https://www.youtube.com/embed/123xxxXXXyZ
	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9USTddwNoXU

Basically, "embed/" instead of "watch?v=".



==============
Embedded Audio
==============

This code::

	.. raw:: html

		<audio controls="controls">
		  <source src="http://tightbytes.com/music/Sketches/Sketch11.mp3" type="audio/wav">
		  Your browser does not support the <code>audio</code> element. 
		</audio>

...produces:

.. raw:: html

    <audio controls="controls">
      <source src="http://tightbytes.com/music/Sketches/Sketch11.mp3" type="audio/wav">
      Your browser does not support the <code>audio</code> element. 
    </audio>



==========================
Embedded Non-youtube Video
==========================

This code::

	.. raw:: html

	   <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://tightbytes.com/videos/projects/garden/Aj-SHTrench.mp4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

...produces:

.. raw:: html

   <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://tightbytes.com/videos/projects/garden/Aj-SHTrench.mp4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>



==================
Creating Dotpoints
==================

Once you've decided:

  * Select A.

  * Select B. 

  * To identify C.

  * Finally, click on D.


Note: *setting things to italics like this makes more impact - these have yielded reasonable results. You will almost certainly find better settings, which is the whole point of sharing this*.



================
Links Management
================

Here's a typical example of embedding a link: Blender-for-Mac users, please refer to the `Mac user help <http://blender.stackexchange.com/questions/6173/where-does-console-output-go>`_ page.



===============
Another Example
===============

As you can see from the example, an example of a fully-qualified path for Linux would be:

   /home/robyn/Documents/Blender/Projects/AllTextures/AllSkin/Antonia/

or, for the Mac:

   /Volumes/500GB/Blender/Projects/AllTextures/AllSkin/Antonia/

or, for Windows:

   E:\\MyRuntime\\runtime\\textures\\VendorName\\ImagesFolder\\Character\\



==========================
Horizontal Separator Lines
==========================

The code is this (minus the '*')::

	* .. raw:: html
   
   <hr style="height:4px;border-width:0;color:gray;background-color:gray">

...which produces this:

.. raw:: html
   
   <hr style="height:4px;border-width:0;color:gray;background-color:gray">

Other Help Tips

=============================
Transfering Money with PayPal
=============================

So, here is my approach:

.. image:: http://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/conundrums/Cm_PayPal01.png

I already have you as a payee (someone I send money to) but you would normally get:

.. image:: http://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/conundrums/Cm_PayPal02.png

...and then, how much. Do $10. Leave it at USD: you'll know how huch you've already sent if you're doing it incrememtally.

.. image:: http://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/conundrums/Cm_PayPal04.png

Then, the "How would you like to pay?"...

.. image:: http://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/conundrums/Cm_PayPal05.png

you would normally have an account tied to your PayPal account. I have my Savings account (Anz) that I transfer money into. If you haven't done that yet - associated an account to PayPal - you may need to do that. It will do a summary:

.. image:: http://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/conundrums/Cm_PayPal07.png

...and you just click [Send Money Now] - which exercise I did just now, so I could do these screen shots - and I'll get notification:

.. image:: http://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/conundrums/Cm_PayPal08.png

... that you sent me money. Easy-peasy. :)




===========================
Changing Settings in Chrome
===========================

These tips pertain to Chrome for Mac: doesn't matter much with version of the Mac operating system, as far as I can tell. Open the Chrome browser:

.. image:: http://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/conundrums/Cm_Chrome-4.png

Mine is already open which is why I've got a white dot to the left of it. A key link on your Chrome browser is the one to your settings page. This is in the upper right-hand corner of the browser:

.. image:: http://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/conundrums/Cm_Chrome-5.png

When you click on this, you get the following menu, from which you select 'Settings':

.. image:: http://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/conundrums/Cm_Chrome-6.png

However, to turn off 'dark mode' in Chrome, you actually go to a new search page:

.. image:: http://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/conundrums/Cm_Chrome-1.png

At the bottom right-hand corner is another settings link:

.. image:: http://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/conundrums/Cm_Chrome-2.png

If you click on the 'Dark theme: On' menu item, it will turn Dark Theme: Off.

.. image:: http://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/conundrums/Cm_Chrome-3.png

Hope this helps.

Film Projects

I can unequivocably state: right now in June 2022, I suck at video. Reason: compostion. Which is why I'm taking this course:

`Tomorrow's Filmmakers <https://academy.tomorrowsfilmmakers.com/>`_.

Worth every penny!

Excellent Youtube channel on budget filmmaking: `Nigel Barros <https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCV_i_0uE8IlSenyJY0yBgdw>`_. When he hit 100K subscribers, he put out this `excellent video <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9USTddwNoXU>`_ on the whole creating content idea that actually can be applied to whatever endeavour one might engage in, whether filmmaking or gardening or bonsai or cardmaking... whatever.
