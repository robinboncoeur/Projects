Why these Projects Pages? 
*************************

I guess what set it off was trying to upload images to a GMail email I was sending to Martin and Esther on 2022-Apr-15. Got about halfway through and GMail told me I'd exceeded the size limit (25mb). Which seems silly. And there's no video, even... just pictures.

What appeals to me about doing project progress sharing this way is:

	* I can share a LOT of information no-cost
	
	* The information is hidden in obscurity of "no-one gives a rat's nether-regions about what I'm doing"... *(just have a look at `Tightbytes <https://www.tightbytes.com/>`_. Visitors? none)*. 
	
	* Updating is a lot quicker and easier on GitHub than on Tightbytes... LOTS easier!
	
I'm doing this with dates as the sort-of the link key. For example, I'll give whoever I'm writing an email to, as a link, the current entry into a give project page, like so::

	https://robinboncoeur.github.io/Projects/RSTs/Garden.html#apr-23
	
Sphinx is really good that way! By the way, the images have been uniformly resized (for the most part) to 1024 x 768 pixels. They are not displayed in that resolution, but right-clicking and choosing "Open image in a New Tab..." will display that image in full resolution. 



.. raw:: html
   
   <hr style="height:4px;border-width:0;color:gray;background-color:gray">




*************************************
Reminders [to Myself] of Sphinx Stuff
*************************************

=============
Inline images
=============

For externally-stored images (most will be stored on Tightbytes, for my pages)::

	* .. image:: http://www.tightbytes.com/Music/CReinecke/CReinecke1890.jpg

and for those stored with the data files::

	* .. image:: ../images/blAltRtClick01.png



==============
Embedded Video
==============

This code::

.. raw:: html
   
   <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/123xxxXXXyZ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

   <hr style="height:4px;border-width:0;color:gray;background-color:gray">

Should have 11 characters::

	3LbsmS5TJXA
	123xxxXXXyZ



==============
Embedded Audio
==============

This code::

	.. raw:: html

		<audio controls="controls">
		  <source src="http://tightbytes.com/music/Sketches/Sketch11.mp3" type="audio/wav">
		  Your browser does not support the <code>audio</code> element. 
		</audio>

...produces:

.. raw:: html

    <audio controls="controls">
      <source src="http://tightbytes.com/music/Sketches/Sketch11.mp3" type="audio/wav">
      Your browser does not support the <code>audio</code> element. 
    </audio>



==================
Creating Dotpoints
==================

Once you've decided:

  * Select A.

  * Select B. 

  * To identify C.

  * Finally, click on D.


Note: *setting things to italics like this makes more impact - these have yielded reasonable results. You will almost certainly find better settings, which is the whole point of sharing this*.



================
Links Management
================

Here's a typical example of embedding a link: Blender-for-Mac users, please refer to the `Mac user help <http://blender.stackexchange.com/questions/6173/where-does-console-output-go>`_ page.



===============
Another Example
===============

As you can see from the example, an example of a fully-qualified path for Linux would be:

   /home/robyn/Documents/Blender/Projects/AllTextures/AllSkin/Antonia/

or, for the Mac:

   /Volumes/500GB/Blender/Projects/AllTextures/AllSkin/Antonia/

or, for Windows:

   E:\\MyRuntime\\runtime\\textures\\VendorName\\ImagesFolder\\Character\\



==========================
Horizontal Separator Lines
==========================

The code is this (minus the '*')::

	* .. raw:: html
   
   <hr style="height:4px;border-width:0;color:gray;background-color:gray">

...which produces this:

.. raw:: html
   
   <hr style="height:4px;border-width:0;color:gray;background-color:gray">
