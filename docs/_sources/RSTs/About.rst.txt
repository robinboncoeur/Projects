My Projects Pages 
*****************

I was trying to upload images to a GMail email I was sending to Martin and Esther on 2022-Apr-15. Got about halfway through and GMail told me I would exceeded the size limit (25mb). Which seems silly in this day and age: this was without trying to send a video, even. Just pictures.

What appeals to me about doing project progress sharing this way is:

	* I can share a LOT of information no-cost
	
	* The information is hidden in obscurity of "no-one gives a rat's nether-regions about what I'm doing". *Just have a look at my website:* `Tightbytes.com <https://www.tightbytes.com/>`_. *Visitors? none*. 
	
	* Updating is a lot quicker on GitHub than on Tightbytes: I edit locally, then use Github Desktop to manage the update to my pages.
	
	* Since the pages are hosted on GitHub, other family and friends could collaborate on this pages, and even add pages of their own.
	
Some section use dates as a sort-of link key. For example, I'll give whoever I'm writing an email to, as a link, the current entry into a give project page, like so:

	`https://robinboncoeur.github.io/Projects/RSTs/Garden.html#apr-23 <https://robinboncoeur.github.io/Projects/RSTs/Garden.html#apr-23>`_
	
Sphinx is really cool that way! By the way, the images have been uniformly resized (for the most part) to 1024 x 768 pixels. They are not displayed in that resolution, but right-clicking and choosing "Open image in a New Tab..." will display that image in a somewhat larger resolution.

===================
A Bit about the Why
===================

First off, it's about sharing. That was sort-of my primary motivation for `TightBytes <https://tightbytes.com/>`_ - which sees pretty much no visitors ... whatever - and is what drives these pages. As you can tell from the next section, a bit of the reason was so I had a centralised location for reminders and links to stuff and so forth. Getting old bites the big one, and I'll sometimes find myself out and about - away from my PC - trying to do something I absolutely *Know* how to do... yeah, but can't remember **exactly** how to do it.

Perhaps the reason I forget is because I use so many "tools". 

What do I mean by "tools"?

These pages - the one's on Github, currently (2022) - are created (typed) in a program (free) called "Brackets". So, not in MS Word of on Notepad or other text editor, but `Brackets <https://brackets.io/>`_. The reason for that is Brackets is a plain-text editor for programmers: it allows you to include text (and other) formatting code to be included in your text. The formatting codes aren't visible to the person reading the resultant page... thus::

	...here is how I do ** bold** and *italic*...

produces "...here is how I do **bold** and *italic*...".

These are all mechanisms designed for what these pages are designed for: `Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html>`_, which uses reStructuredText as the default plain-text markup 'language'. Just like in other languages, programming 'languages' have certain rules so that you can pretty much get the same results all the time in a given environment. On the web, the most common 'language' is HTML::

	<HTML>
	
	<HEAD> header content here
	</HEAD>
	
	<BODY> body of the text here
	</BODY>
	
	</HTML>

It is essentially a markup language, meaning you insert the formatting 'tags' - in HTML, it would be words enclosed by lesser-than and greater-than symbols - when you create the document which the interpreter sees as instructions on how the text should look or behave. Being comfortable in that "language" is just a matter of doing it enough, just like any other language.

HTML is just one such "tool". reStructured Text is another - these pages are formatted using reST. VBA is another, Python yet another... and after a while, I end up needing a reference on how certain tasks are performed, particularly if I hadn't done them in a while.

I have another GitHub help page site called `Help Yrself <https://robinboncoeur.github.io/HelpYrself/>`_ that catalogues tasks I sort-of learned to do, but then, since it wasn't something I did every day, needed to be saved somewhere for when I needed that information again.

=============
Inline images
=============

For externally-stored images (most will be stored on Tightbytes, for my pages)::

	* .. image:: http://www.tightbytes.com/Music/CReinecke/CReinecke1890.jpg

and for those stored with the data files::

======================
Embedded YouTube Video
======================

This code::

   .. raw:: html
   
   <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/123xxxXXXyZ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

   <hr style="height:4px;border-width:0;color:gray;background-color:gray">

Should have 11 characters::

	3LbsmS5TJXA
	123xxxXXXyZ

Key to note is the difference in the link in the raw html syntax vs the actual youtube link::

	https://www.youtube.com/embed/123xxxXXXyZ
	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9USTddwNoXU

Basically, "embed/" instead of "watch?v=".



==============
Embedded Audio
==============

This code::

	.. raw:: html

		<audio controls="controls">
		  <source src="http://tightbytes.com/music/Sketches/Sketch11.mp3" type="audio/wav">
		  Your browser does not support the <code>audio</code> element. 
		</audio>

...produces:

.. raw:: html

    <audio controls="controls">
      <source src="http://tightbytes.com/music/Sketches/Sketch11.mp3" type="audio/wav">
      Your browser does not support the <code>audio</code> element. 
    </audio>



==========================
Embedded Non-youtube Video
==========================

This code::

	.. raw:: html

	   <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://tightbytes.com/videos/projects/garden/Aj-SHTrench.mp4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

...produces:

.. raw:: html

   <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://tightbytes.com/videos/projects/garden/Aj-SHTrench.mp4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

(Note to self: took out  [  autoplay; ] )



==================
Creating Dotpoints
==================

Once you've decided:

  * Select A.

  * Select B. 

  * To identify C.

  * Finally, click on D.


Note: *setting things to italics like this makes more impact - these have yielded reasonable results. You will almost certainly find better settings, which is the whole point of sharing this*.



================
Links Management
================

Here's a typical example of embedding a link: Blender-for-Mac users, please refer to the `Mac user help <http://blender.stackexchange.com/questions/6173/where-does-console-output-go>`_ page.




==========================
Horizontal Separator Lines
==========================

The code is this (minus the '*')::

	* .. raw:: html
   
   <hr style="height:4px;border-width:0;color:gray;background-color:gray">

...which produces the following grey horizonal bar to help separate sctions (like the one below).

Changing Settings in Chrome
===========================

These tips pertain to Chrome for Mac: doesn't matter much which version of the Mac operating system, as far as I can tell. Open the Chrome browser:

.. image:: http://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/conundrums/Cm_Chrome-4.png

Mine is already open which is why I've got a white dot to the left of it. A key link on your Chrome browser is the one to your settings page. This is in the upper right-hand corner of the browser:

.. image:: http://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/conundrums/Cm_Chrome-5.png

When you click on this, you get the following menu, from which you select 'Settings':

.. image:: http://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/conundrums/Cm_Chrome-6.png

However, to turn off 'dark mode' in Chrome, you actually go to a new search page:

.. image:: http://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/conundrums/Cm_Chrome-1.png

At the bottom right-hand corner is another settings link:

.. image:: http://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/conundrums/Cm_Chrome-2.png

If you click on the 'Dark theme: On' menu item, it will turn Dark Theme: Off.

Hope this helps.

How to Do Google Meet
=====================

**Setting up A Meet**

The following instruction are for when YOU want to set up a Meet, as opposed to joining a Meet someone else set up (i.e., accepting an invitation). To make it easier, I tend to use 'Calendar' that comes with GMail.... that way, I don't have to hunt through emails to find an invitation: it's right there in my GMail calendar. The Gmail Calendar has a little 31 in it:

.. image:: http://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/conundrums/Meet/Meet-01.png

By the way (BTW), if you don't see that Calendar icon in your right-sidebar, go down to the bottow of the page and click on:

.. image:: http://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/conundrums/Meet/Meet-20.png

Then, it will appear up near the top of the right sidebar, along with other useful GMail apps. When you click on the icon, it'll bring up that day's events. As you can see, the get-together we had worked out a few days back is displayed in my calendar. 

.. image:: http://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/conundrums/Meet/Meet-02.png

Double-clicking on this event brings up all the details, including a link to the "Meet" page, generally visible in the middle of that event.

For example, here's how I set up our next meeting, for next Tuesday arvo, your time; Wednesday morning, my time. I click on the date under the  word "Calendar" near the top of that dialogue (top arrow) and then, select the date from the pop-up calendar.

.. image:: http://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/conundrums/Meet/Meet-04.png

I have date set up to GMT + 10hrs (which is Brisbane time) in my GMail settings. I already know that Wednesday morning at seven am is going to be Tuesday afternoon at 2pm your time. So, I add a title - not strictly necessary, but it is helpful - and set the time, and Click on "Add Google Meet video Conference":

.. image:: http://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/conundrums/Meet/Meet-07.png

I also add a description: this is a great way to share objectives and other thoughts. 

.. image:: http://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/conundrums/Meet/Meet-09.png

Remember, the "Join With Google Meet" brings up the "Meet" page, enabling you to join.

When you click on "Add Guests": your most-contacted email recipients should appear in a list:

.. image:: http://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/conundrums/Meet/Meet-10.png

Now, you should see yourself as organiser and the guest list underneath your name. It's going to be truly awesome when we get some of the others onboard with this!

.. image:: http://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/conundrums/Meet/Meet-11.png

When you click "Save" at the bottom of that event:

.. image:: http://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/conundrums/Meet/Meet-12.png

you'll be prompted to send invitations to to everyone on the guest list - saves you from having to manually send out invitations.

**Accepting an Invitation**

I've gone ahead and installed Google Calender on my iPad, and created a dummy "Google Meet" for my "r********ahn@gmail.com" gmail account using my "r*****veil@gmail.com" so I can share some screen-shots of what you might see and know what to click on. A pointer that first came up when I set this up read as follows:

.. image:: http://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/conundrums/Meet/Meet-14.png

In the email on my "Invited" email account - which is typically, usually going to be you since I'll mostly set up these for now until you get the hang of it - you simply click on "Yes:

.. image:: http://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/conundrums/Meet/Meet-16.png

or here:

.. image:: http://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/conundrums/Meet/Meet-17.png

That's in your email invitation. Doing so will add it to your Calendar, which will look like this:

.. image:: http://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/conundrums/Meet/Meet-18.png

When you click on that event, it will bring up that event, and in the event you'll simply click on the "Join with Google Meet" link, which will bring up Google Meet, activating video and you're good to go.

Music Projects
**************

(Note: *formerly "Film Projects"*) I can unequivocably state: right now in June 2022, I suck at video. Reason: compostion. Which is why I'm taking this course:

`Tomorrow's Filmmakers <https://academy.tomorrowsfilmmakers.com/>`_.

Initially, I assessed it at being worth every penny. However, I really am a bit conflicted about the main presenter, who infuses his instruction with, for lack of a better term, 'religiosity'. I mean, the message sounds like he's promoting Christianity - I'm a Christian, and you would think I'd see him as a kindred spirit - but somehow the message seems: off. Like, this is about film-making techniques. If I follow a guide on composition, it would feel equally awkward and forced to keep getting the instructor's religious viewpoints and exhortations. Oh well, it was US$100. You get what you pay for.

I've since signed up for the full "Musescore bank of courses... there's `heaps <https://musescore.com/courses>`_. They were having an 85% off sale, so it seemed to be a really good idea. Turns out: it totally is. Remember, Musescore is a free download. You want to write music? this is the way to go.

Music for Film
==============

I'd like to start making the sort of music that fits with film: a sound that helps make more clear what the film is trying to say. So I've started scoring a new piece... it's in B minor, starts in the woodwinds with bass strings providing a sort of heartbeat (pizzicato).

So far, I have this:

.. image:: http://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/composition/Sk13a.png

It's wintertime in Southeast Queensland. Nights are quite cool - actually feels cold to us. The noise of cars and other machines finally diminish in the evening, for which I'm rather grateful. That's what I'm trying to say with the first few bars of this piece.
