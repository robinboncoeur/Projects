Before we dive into the study of Harmony, it's important to make sure we're all on the same page when it comes to the basics. Even though it’s assumed that anyone starting composition already has a solid understanding of music theory, it’s still a good idea to begin with a quick review of intervals. If your understanding of intervals is a little shaky, it can make learning harmony more difficult than it needs to be.

An interval is simply the relationship between two notes, based on where they sit in the scale. The lower of the two notes is called the root or fundamental tone. The names we give to intervals come from Latin ordinal numbers—like second, third, fourth—which count the number of steps from the lower note to the higher one.

  While it must be supposed that the elements of musical science are familiar to everyone about to take up the art of composition, I deem it advisable to preface my treatise on Harmony with a short review of the subject of intervals, as any uncertain conceptions on this ground might easily prove a hindrance to a thorough knowledge of Harmony. The term "Interval" represents the mutual relation of the tones with regard to their position in the scale. The lower tone of an interval is called the 'fundamental' tone. The names of the intervals have their derivation in the Latin Ordinals, designating numerically the steps between fundamental tone and upper tone.

The raising or lowering of a tone of an interval causes no change in its name, while the distance between the two tones is widened or shortened. To obtain a clear view of such alterations of intervals, we will arrange the latter into two groups.

  * Group I comprising: large (major), small (minor), augmented and diminished intervals; (to which belong Seconds, Thirds, Sixths and Sevenths)
  * Group II comprising: perfect, augmented and diminished intervals; (to which belong: Primes, Octaves, Fifths and Fourths) 
  
Minor intervals are half a tone smaller than major intervals; augmented intervals are half a tone !arger than either major or perfect ones; while diminished intervals are half a tone smaller than minor or perfect intervals. All intervals having for tbeir fundamental tone the first degree of the major scale are either major or perfect.

Let us now ascertain the number of whole and semi-tones contained in each of these intervals, thus establishing a scale or medium of comparison for all intervals:

Having then obtained a knowledge of the various kinds of intervals and the means of gauging them, we are enabled to constitute exactly any relation between two given tones. To illustrate the aforesaid, we will construct a table of all the intervals baving C for their fundamental tone:

  * A major Second  contains 1      whole tone
  * A major Third   contains 2      whole tones
  * A pure  Fourth  contains 2 1/2  whole tones
  * A pure  Fifth   contains 3 1/2  whole tones
  * A major Sixth   contains 4 1/2  whole tones
  * A major Seventh contains 5 1/2  whole tones
  * A pure  Octave  contains 6      whole tones
  * A pure  Prime   contains 0      whole tones

Thus, we learn that a major or a pure Interval is converted into a minor, diminished or augmented Interval by lowering or raising the upper tone - or, the latter remaining unchanged, by raising or lowering the fnndamental tone. For instance:

Intervals exceeding the octave are but repetitions of the relations existing within the limits of an octave; the "Ninth" alone has an independent significance in harmony.

The inversion of Intervals is effected by transposing the upper tone into the octave below or the fundamental tone into the octave above. The relations thus arising may be expressed by the following figures...

The inverted Prime becomes an Octave, the Second a Seventh, the Third a Sixth, the Fourth a Fifth, the Fifth a Fourtb, the Sixth a Third, the Seventh a Second, the Octave a Prime.

Major intervals become minor, while minor intervals become major; augmented intervals become diminished, diminished intervals augmented; pure intervals however remain pure.

According to the manner in which they affect the ear, intervals are separated into *Consonances* and *Dissonances*. The former are complete in themselves, as they express a certain *repose*; the latter, however, convey the element of motion and demand a goal or solution in the following interval.

Pure Primes, Octaves and Fifths as well as major and minor Thirds and Sixtbs are consonances, the first three being termed *perfect consonances*, and the major and minor Thirds and Sixths *imperfect consonances*. Seconds, Sevenths and all augmented and diminished intervals are dissonances. The pure Fourth partakes of the nature of both consonance and dissonance, inclining rather to the latter class.
