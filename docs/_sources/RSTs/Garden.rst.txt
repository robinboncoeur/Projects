So, here's where Blender came to the rescue to help visualise some ideas:

Come to think of it, think that it's probably not as practical to have a gabled roof of that type. Perhaps a lean-to approach might be more useful.

Anyway, removed all the gardening stuff (pots and tools and soil in bags and clay marbles for hydroponics and on and on, endless collection of stuff over the years!) that was in the corner - washed anything that looked useful; if not, it got thrown - and dismantled the bed furthest from the camera:

When the decking came up, I saw the extent of the issue. The floor frame had terrible rot issues. It will have to be replaced:

And, extended. Also, the ag pipe that deals with storm rain-water in the front yard was directed to the frame and - worse yet - the neighbour's fence. It will need to be re-routed to our back yard. Hours and hours of back-breaking work ahead!

You know how when you start getting into a project, it sort-of just grows? We've been having problems with standing water in our front yard during heavy downpours. Whilst the house is built on a slab, we're seeing cracks develop where they just shouldn't. Some time ago we'd engaged some gardening dudes to put down some ag pipe to drain off that water. That ag pipe:

... yep, those two back plasic pipes are humped over the watertank overflow. Not going to work, is it? Water has issues running uphill, I've been told.

here's wher it used to empty into, towards the mattock (pick):

At the bottom of this bed, I'm going to have to reinforce the bottom of the side to keep the soil all drifting out:

Actually have a bit of time to update this page as we're have a young visitor - Harriet! - and gave myself the excuse that it was too warm to work on it today. However, it cooled down nicely, and after doing a bit of "blue-ing" on rusty stuff I'm trying to ressurect, I finally got stuck into it and finished pulling the dead stuff out:

And why do all this? For the cuccumbers

and parsley

and echallots (spring onions):

So, here's the thing: when we buy echallots here in Oz, we generally get the roots and all. I have found that you can stick these into the ground and generally they will take. We used to have tons of spring onions! almost never had to buy any for quite a while. Lately, though, whatever I planted never seemed to survive longer than a night or so It's likely a rat or a possum. Anyway, going to try to get the plant established by keeping it covered. We'll see how we go.
