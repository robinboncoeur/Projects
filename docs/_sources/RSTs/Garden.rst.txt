So, here's where Blender came to the rescue to help visualise some ideas:

Come to think of it, think that it's probably not as practical to have a gabled rook of that type. Perhaps a lean-to approach might be more useful.

Anyway, took out the mess that was in the corner - washed anything that looked useful; if not, off it went to the tip - and dismantled the bed furthest from the camera:

When the decking came up, I saw the extent of the issue. The floor frame had terrible rot issues. It will have to be replaced:

And, extended. Also, the ag pipe that deals with storm rain-water in the front yard was directed to the frame and - worse yet - the neighbour's fence. It will need to be re-routed to our back yard. Hours and hours of back-breaking work ahead!
