# About Projects

## Foreword

I was trying to upload images to an email I was sending to Martin and Esther on 2022-Apr-15. Got about halfway through and Gmail told me I would exceed the size limit (25mb). Which seems silly in this day and age: this was without trying to send a video, even. Just pictures.

What appeals to me about doing project progress sharing this way is:

- I can share a LOT of information no-cost

- The information is hidden in obscurity of "no-one gives a rat's nether-regions about what I'm doing". Have a look at [my website: Tightbytes.com](https://www.tightbytes.com). Visitors? none. 

- Updating is a lot quicker on GitHub than on Tightbytes: I edit locally, then use Github Desktop to manage the update to my pages.

- Since the pages are hosted on GitHub, other family and friends could collaborate on this pages, and even add pages of their own.
	
Some sections use dates as a sort-of link key. For example, I'll give whoever I'm writing an email to, as a link, the current entry into a given project page, like so:

  [https://robinboncoeur.github.io/Projects/RSTs/Garden.html#apr-23](https://robinboncoeur.github.io/Projects/RSTs/Garden.html#apr-23)

To format pages into websites, I was using restructured text (Sphinx), which was really cool, but a bit time consuming. It was more for code documentation, so ease-of-use wasn't a big priority. I'm now using markdown, which is much easier to use. Fun fact: *HTML is actually a markdown language - you enter the formatting tags as you write the page.* Cool thing about markdown: you can combine HTML with markdown, which I do quite a bit, like, for the videos below.

## Update Log

Update 2025.08.24: In my previous Sphinx-based help files - reminding myself how to do techie and other stuff - I had a 'Projects' site and a 'Help Yourself' site. I'm merging the two to just 'Projects.'

---

Update 2025.08.21: Migrating 'Projects' site from AllHelp (ReST) to markdown (MkDocs), hosted on Cloudflare, with data githubbed then pages created dynamically in Cloudflare. This decision was taken as Tightbytes.com as a Wordpress website was costing a fortune (USD#359.00 / 48 months) which can't be justified. So, once my subscription with Hostinger expires in 2027.12.09, I will not renew, and all pages except the main wordpress page will have been migrated. Still not sure what to do about that.  
There will be subdomains for the Help (and other) pages: projects.tightbytes.com, art.projects.com, appmgr.tightbytes.com, keys2life.tightbytes.com and so on.

The film "Portrait de la Jeune Fille En Feu" lit the fuse that inspired the Celeste story. It also inspired this piece, 'Waterfall':
