# About Projects

## Table Of Contents

This is a temporary measure for access to the site for readers on a phone or tablet. I need to get the banner resizing properly. Hopefully soon: in the meantime, here's links to the main pages.

## Foreword

**Originally:**  
Some time ago, I wanted to email some pictures to Martin and Esther: this was on 2022-Apr-15. Got about halfway through and Gmail told me I would exceed the size limit (25mb). Which seems silly in this day and age: this was without trying to send a video, even. Just pictures. Note: nowadays if you exceed the size limit, it plops the attachment on your GoogleDrive with a link, and does it seamlessly, but that's now. Back then, it wasn't quite so easy.

So, which solutions to try?

I decided tightbytes.com would act as my public file server via Github, using Cloudflare to create static web pages. What appealed about doing project progress sharing this way was:

- I could share a LOT of information about projects quickly  
- The information was hidden in obscurity of "no-one gives a rat's nether-regions about what I'm doing". Have a look at [my website: Tightbytes.com](https://www.tightbytes.com). Visitors? none.  
- Updating was a lot quicker on GitHub than on Tightbytes: I would edit locally in Brackets, then use Sphinx/Make-the-Docs to make the static HTML pages, and Github Desktop to manage the update to GithubPages.  
- Since the pages were hosted on GitHub, other family and friends could collaborate on this pages, and even add pages of their own.

Time moves on. I got a notification from Hostinger my next 2-year subscription was going to set me back AUD $546.00 - (USD#359.00 / 48 months).

It was time to rethink things, including how the pages are created and maintained. 

Sphinx/ReadTheDocs was more trouble than benefit: in essence it was using a wrench as a hammer. So, began migrating the 'Projects' site from AllHelp (Sphinx/ReadTheDocs - ReST) to markdown (MkDocs), hosted on Cloudflare. I would upload files and images to my github site (free) and then Cloudflare would dynamically create the webpages.  
There are (and will be) subdomains for all the old Help pages: projects.tightbytes.com, art.projects.com, appmgr.tightbytes.com, keys2life.tightbytes.com and so on.

## Update Log

Update 2025.10.29:  
- added Person2.md to the visual folder
- splintering Blog2025 into months ... Sep2025 / Oct2025


Update 2025.10.24:  
- changed garden and blog post order to oldest at the top, newest at the bottom  
- Splintered out Blogs and Garden by year  
- Started migrating entries in the old wordpress-based tightbytes site into this 'projects' site  
- Shrank image size, turning images into clickable links

Update 2025.10.10: **NOT** using this css:

```
  .flex-container {display: flex; display-direction: row;}
  .columnA {float: left; padding-right: 20px;}
  .columnB {padding-left: 20px;}
  .left {width: 40%;}
  .right {width: 60%;}
```

...but rather this:

```
<style>
  .flex-container {display: flex; gap: 20px; align-items: flex-start;}
  .column {flex: 1 1 0; min-width: 0;}
  .column--right {border-left: 1px solid var(--md-default-fg-color--lightest); padding-left: 20px; }
</style>
```

Also, figured out (thanks, Emily) how to create a [clickable image link](/tech/Markdown.md/#clickable-image-links). Redid a lot of index pages to just provide links to their respective group.

---

Update 2025.10.04: Moved [Blog posts](/blogs/index.md) into their own category.

---

Update 2025.10.02: Added a category [Visual Art](/visual/index.md). Anything to do with art or video has been moved there. Also, with the receipt of Dad's autobiography, have recommenced photographing physical medium, translation and opening the account for discussion..

---

Update 2025.09.01: Time has moved on, and so have I: from Sphinx-MakeTheDocs to markdown-MkDocs. I'm migrating pages from my *Projects* and *HelpYrSelf* help sites into just one **Projects** pages set.  
On some pages, the latest posts are [on the top](/other/Garden25.md) of the page, older posts below them. Removing some posts for lack of relevancy.

---

Update 2025.08.24: In my previous Sphinx-based help files - reminding myself how to do techie and other stuff - I had a 'Projects' site and a 'Help Yourself' site. I'm merging the two to just 'Projects.'

---

Update 2025.08.21: Migrating 'Projects' site from AllHelp (ReST) to markdown (MkDocs), hosted on Cloudflare, with data githubbed then pages created dynamically in Cloudflare. This decision was taken as Tightbytes.com as a Wordpress website was costing a fortune (USD#359.00 / 48 months) which can't be justified. So, once my subscription with Hostinger expires in 2027.12.09, I will not renew, and all pages except the main wordpress page will have been migrated.  
Still not sure what to do about that.

There will be subdomains for the Help (and other) pages: projects.tightbytes.com, appmgr.tightbytes.com, keys2life.tightbytes.com and so on.

These videos are about the music for the story 'Celeste's Girl':

<style>
  .columnA {float: left; padding-right: 20px;}
  .left {width: 40%;}
  .right {width: 60%;}
</style>

<div class="row">
  <div class="columnA">
    <video width="384" height="384" controls>
      <source src="https://www.tightbytes.com/music/Sketches/Sketch15.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    </video>
    <br>
    [Version FranÃ§aise]
  </div>
  <div class="columnB">
    <video width="384" height="384" controls>
      <source src="https://www.tightbytes.com/music/Sketches/Sketch15EN.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    </video>
    <br>
    [English Version]

  </div>
</div>


The film "Portrait de la Jeune Fille En Feu" lit the fuse that inspired the Celeste story. It also inspired this piece, 'Waterfall':

Sorry, going to put this up: needs to be said.
