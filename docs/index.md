## Table Of Contents

This is a temporary measure for access to the site for readers on a phone or tablet. I need to get the banner resizing properly. Hopefully soon: in the meantime, here's links to the main pages.

## Foreword

**Originally:**  
I was trying to upload images to an email I was sending to Martin and Esther on 2022-Apr-15. Got about halfway through and Gmail told me I would exceed the size limit (25mb). Which seems silly in this day and age: this was without trying to send a video, even. Just pictures.

So, what solutions are out there?

Well, now-a-days, GMail will upload your >25mB file to your Google Drive (you get 15 gig for free on any GMail account), creates a link in your email and... done. But, back in '22, that all had to be done manually. So, I set up tightbytes.com to act as my public file server. What appealed about doing project progress sharing this way was:

- I could share a LOT of information about projects quickly  
- The information was hidden in obscurity of "no-one gives a rat's nether-regions about what I'm doing". Have a look at [my website: Tightbytes.com](https://www.tightbytes.com). Visitors? none.  
- Updating was a lot quicker on GitHub than on Tightbytes: I would edit locally in Brackets, then use Sphinx/Make-the-Docs to make the static HTML pages, and Github Desktop to manage the update to GithubPages.  
- Since the pages were hosted on GitHub, other family and friends could collaborate on this pages, and even add pages of their own.

**2025-Sept**  
Time has moved on, and so have I: from Sphinx/Make-The_Docs. I'm now migrating pages from *Projects* and *HelpYrSelf* into this one **Projects** set of pages. At this point,things are organised a bit... differently. Latest posts are [on the top](http://127.0.0.1:8000/other/Garden/), for some pages. Others will be removed for lack of relevancy.

## Update Log

Update 2025.10.02: Added a category [Visual Art](/visual/index.md). Anything to do with art or video has been moved there. Also, with the receipt of Dad's autobiography, have recommenced photographing physical medium, translation and opening the account for discussion..

---

Update 2025.08.24: In my previous Sphinx-based help files - reminding myself how to do techie and other stuff - I had a 'Projects' site and a 'Help Yourself' site. I'm merging the two to just 'Projects.'

---

Update 2025.08.21: Migrating 'Projects' site from AllHelp (ReST) to markdown (MkDocs), hosted on Cloudflare, with data githubbed then pages created dynamically in Cloudflare. This decision was taken as Tightbytes.com as a Wordpress website was costing a fortune (USD#359.00 / 48 months) which can't be justified. So, once my subscription with Hostinger expires in 2027.12.09, I will not renew, and all pages except the main wordpress page will have been migrated.  
Still not sure what to do about that.

There will be subdomains for the Help (and other) pages: projects.tightbytes.com, appmgr.tightbytes.com, keys2life.tightbytes.com and so on.

These videos are about the music for the story 'Celeste's Girl':

The film "Portrait de la Jeune Fille En Feu" lit the fuse that inspired the Celeste story. It also inspired this piece, 'Waterfall':
