# About Projects

## Foreword

I was trying to upload images to an email I was sending to Martin and Esther on 2022-Apr-15. Got about halfway through and Gmail told me I would exceed the size limit (25mb). Which seems silly in this day and age: this was without trying to send a video, even. Just pictures.

What appeals to me about doing project progress sharing this way is:

  * I can share a LOT of information no-cost

  * The information is hidden in obscurity of "no-one gives a rat's nether-regions about what I'm doing". *Just have a look at [my website: Tightbytes.com](https://www.tightbytes.com). *Visitors? none*. 

  * Updating is a lot quicker on GitHub than on Tightbytes: I edit locally, then use Github Desktop to manage the update to my pages.

  * Since the pages are hosted on GitHub, other family and friends could collaborate on this pages, and even add pages of their own.
	
Some sections use dates as a sort-of link key. For example, I'll give whoever I'm writing an email to, as a link, the current entry into a given project page, like so:

  [https://robinboncoeur.github.io/Projects/RSTs/Garden.html#apr-23](https://robinboncoeur.github.io/Projects/RSTs/Garden.html#apr-23)

Sphinx is really cool that way! By the way, the images have been uniformly resized (for the most part) to 1024 x 768 pixels. They are not displayed in that resolution, but right-clicking and choosing "Open image in a New Tab..." will display that image in a somewhat larger resolution.

The film "Portrait de la Jeune Fille En Feu" lit the fuse that inspired the Celeste story. It also inspired this piece, 'Waterfall':
