# Our Garden At Seabrae

I hope to cover anything going on outside the house, including growbeds, footpath and how we finally got rid of (re-purposed) all that nasty pumice gravel. I'll try to remember to put the newer stuff at the top of this page.

Be sure to turn on 'night-time' mode (it's the little moon icon next to the search field at the top of the page) in order to see the pictures a bit better.

## 2025 - Coffee and Successes

Might show you failures as well, but for now, just what we've been successful at growing.

![Herbs](https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/garden/2025/Coffee2025-01.jpg)

We've lined most of the garden beds, to prevent the timber from rotting. I've got one more to line: this clump of 'common' thyme is from the adjoining bed yet to be lined.

![Herbs](https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/garden/2025/Coffee2025-02.jpg)

This tiny clump is my pride-and-joy: Margoram!! Can't even get it in the shops anymore here in Oz... but it's an essential for Italian dishes.

![Herbs](https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/garden/2025/Coffee2025-03.jpg)

I believe these little battlers are lemon thyme. We'll see how they do in spring... nothing is really going crazy growing now.

![Herbs](https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/garden/2025/Coffee2025-04.jpg)

3 strawberry plants with flowers. So far, so good. Going to be putting coffee pucks (spent coffee ground pucks) near them to discourage slugs and such. The marigolds are also meant to ward off pests, all except perhaps the 'bin chooks': 

!['bin chooks'](https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/garden/2025/Australian_Ibis.jpg)

...(threskiornis molucca) as we call them (bin=rubbish bin;chook=chicken). They don't actually eat the plants, but they tend to trample on the young plants and crush them... hence the sticks in the ground. Actually seems to work.

![Herbs](https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/garden/2025/Coffee2025-05.jpg)

We call these 'spring onions'. When we buy a bunch at Woolies (like Safeway) I whack off the bottom 3-4 inches - the bit with the roots - and stick that into the ground. So, we have tons of that. Behind that, you can make out the parsley (transplanted successfully from the adjoining, now-replenished bed in the background) and the rosemary, also transplanted. I've tried to transplant rosemary before but failed. I'm delighted this one has done so well!

![Coffee](https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/garden/2025/Coffee2025-06.jpg)

A couple of coffee plants with marigold and parsley. I expect these will take off in the spring. I'll have to keep them trimmed back - they tend to grow quite tall.

![Coffee](https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/garden/2025/Coffee2025-07.jpg)

Perpetual spinach. Julia isn't fussed on the taste, but I love it. And it just grows and grows. BTW, this is the bed that I'll be emptying and putting a liner into.

![Herbs](https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/garden/2025/Coffee2025-08.jpg)

Basil, flowers (so Harri-girl has something to pick) and more margoram.

![Coffee](https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/garden/2025/Coffee2025-11.jpg)

The coffee **bush** (breynia oblongifolia) is considered an invasive weed by Brisbane City Council. They're not the same thing as the coffee *plant* (coffea arabica). The council just next to Brisbane City Council - Redlands Council, in which we live - used to have instructions on how to grow your own coffee plants. Those instructions seem to have been taken down.

As you can see, they're happy little self-seeding plants, so I get why environmental types are a bit cautious. They tend to feel the same way about blackberry bushes and guava trees.{{{sigh}}}

![Coffee](https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/garden/2025/Coffee2025-12.jpg)

Almost all of those little wide-leaf plants on the ground are young coffee plants. I'm going to leave some and transplant others.  

![Coffee](https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/garden/2025/Coffee2025-13.jpg)

A full-grown coffee plant. I'll be chopping it back later this year.

![Coffee](https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/garden/2025/Coffee2025-14.jpg)

Coffee 'cherries' - been a really good year!

![Coffee](https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/garden/2025/Coffee2025-15.jpg)

I'll probably leave this one alone for now, until the others get established.

![Coffee](https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/garden/2025/Coffee2025-16.jpg)

Gotta lift up the branches to find where they're hiding.

![Coffee](https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/garden/2025/Coffee2025-17.jpg)

Some folks use the pulpy bit and make jam from it. Aren't they gorgeous!

![Coffee](https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/garden/2025/Coffee2025-22.jpg)

Harvested and ready to be smooshed in the morter and pestle. The pulp goes in the compost, and the beans go:

![Coffee](https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/garden/2025/Coffee2025-23.jpg)

...here, to ferment for a week.

![Coffee](https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/garden/2025/Coffee2025-24.jpg)

Then, we dry them - for **AGES**!

## 2022 - ReDoing the Footpath

### April 18

We did arlight with cuccumbers:

![Image](https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/garden/Ab-SHBase05.jpg)

and parsley:

![Image](https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/garden/Ab-SHBase04.jpg)

and echallots (spring onions):

![Image](https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/garden/Ab-SHBase08.jpg)

When you buy echallots here in Oz, get generally get the complete plant: roots and all. I have found that if you cut off the bottom bit (about 3-4 inches or so) you can stick these bottom bits into the ground and they will grow into full, healthy plants. 

Using this approach, we used to have tons of spring onions! almost never had to buy any for quite a while. Lately, though, these stumps I planted never seemed to survive longer than a night or so. We finally figured it's likely a rat or a possum having a midnight snack.

So, we're going to try this approach - protecting the stumps until they get going growing - to give the plant a change at successful growth by keeping it covered. 

Indeed, I'll probably have to take this approach with any seedlings. I'd planted a whole bunch of broccoli and beetroot seedlings and the whole lot got decimated by some critter. Very frustrating!

We'll see how we go.

<hr style="height:8px;border-width:0;color:blue;background-color:blue">







### April 20

You know how when you start getting into a project, it sort-of just grows? We've been having problems with standing water in our front yard during heavy downpours. Whilst the house is built on a slab, we're seeing cracks develop where they just shouldn't. Some time ago we'd engaged some gardening dudes to put down some ag pipe to drain off that water. That ag pipe:

![Image](https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/garden/Ab-SHBase01.jpg)

... yep, those two black plastic pipes are humped over the watertank overflow. Not going to work, is it? Water has issues running uphill, I've been told.

Here's where it used to empty into, towards the mattock (pick) and the neighbour's fence:

![Image](https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/garden/Ab-SHBase02.jpg)

At the bottom of this bed, I'm going to have to reinforce the bottom of the side to keep the soil seeping out - those logs are doing a piss-poor job of holding the soil in the bed:

![Image](https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/garden/Ab-SHBase03.jpg)

Actually have a bit of time to update this page as we're have a young visitor - Harriet! - and gave myself the excuse that it was too warm to work on it today. However, it cooled down nicely, and after doing a bit of "blue-ing" on rusty stuff I'm trying to "resurrect", I finally got stuck into it and finished pulling the dead stuff out:

![Image](https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/garden/Ab-SHBase09.jpg)


### April 23

A lot of soil has been "bleeding" out from under the beds. I retrieved over a wheelbarrow-full during this exercise. Some of the beds sinking can probably be attributed to that, the rest, probably the decomposition of the biomass we cover with soil. So, I've placed some 'sacrificial' pieces where a log lived, before:

![Image](https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/garden/Ah-SHBase1.jpg)

'Sacrificial', because another piece is going to live outboard to that:

![Image](https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/garden/Ah-SHBase5.jpg)

...a piece that I've painted in Timber-Protecta, and I sort-of want to minimise contact with soil and this anti-rot paint.

In the ShadeHouse area, I've spread the torn shade sail - which we had to replace:

![Image](https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/garden/Ah-SHBase4.jpg)

...all in an effort of discouraging weed growth and reducing waste (those shade-sails would have ended up in landfill):

![Image](https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/garden/Ah-SHBase8.jpg)

And now, the hard bit: 'rescuing' the river rock mixed in with this nasty pumice-gravel, gravel which will end up under the ShadeHouse foundation.



### April 30

Project update: focus has been on getting my US pension sorted, and so have focused mainly on peripheral tasks, such as getting some of the wood protected and restoring metal bits. I'm actually re-using the screws I used to assemble the decking and grow beds - too expensive to go out and buy new all the time. So, I gave them a rough cleaning and then a soak in a cleaning vinegar bath for a few days, until the bath looks like this:

![Image](https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/garden/Ai-Rust01.jpg)

They got a really good rinsing off, then I left them to thoroughly dry:

![Image](https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/garden/Ai-Rust02.jpg)

I know, they still look pretty rough, don't they? Well, here's where the magic happens. Apparently, the "bad" rust is basically replaced (for the most part) with "good" rust, which you sort-of appreciate once I get the wire brush on them:

![Image](https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/garden/Ai-Rust03.jpg)

Good as gold.



### May 2

Labour Day Weekend: finally able to get stuck back into the shadehouse foundation. I'm going to reuse as much of the pumice-gravel as I can under the decking. Put a separator board between the red cedar chip and the pumice:

![Image](https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/garden/Ai-SHGravel01.jpg)

...and then, the protected pieces fastened in place next to the "sacrificial" ones:

![Image](https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/garden/Ai-SHGravel02.jpg)

![Image](https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/garden/Ai-SHGravel03.jpg)

What's nice about "being your own boss" is the ability to decide when you're done for the day:

![Image](https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/garden/Ai-SHGravel04.jpg)

![Image](https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/garden/Ai-SHGravel05.jpg)

At the same time, all that horrid pumice-gravel is being removed from the front and from the side of the house, to be replaced with river rock (like what's beside the grow bed in this picture):

![Image](https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/garden/Ai-SHGravel06.jpg)

River rock won't get caught in my shoes and dragged back into the house to wreck our bamboo flooring. I'll have those flagstone walkway things for people to walk on - river rock is a bit rough on bare feet, and most people go barefoot most of the time. Probably need to pick up a few more flagstones.


### May 3

Besides "Timber Protecta", I figured if the timber sat on gravel instead of dirt, it would break down more slowly:

![Image](https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/garden/Ai-SHGravel07.jpg)

...so this separator piece (separating pumice-gravel from the eventual river-rock) sits in gravel:

![Image](https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/garden/Ai-SHGravel09.jpg)

And here is where I left things today:

![Image](https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/garden/Ai-SHGravel12.jpg)

Pulled up that ag pipe which will be repurposed for the wicking beds:

![Image](https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/garden/Ai-SHGravel16.jpg)

...to be replaced by two larger-diameter, non-fabric-covered ag pipes which I'm going fan out into the area to maximise drainage:

![Image](https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/garden/Ai-SHGravel17.jpg)

I believe this technigue is called "french drainage" except it is commonly applied with gravel. We'll be using river-rock. Flagstones will provide a place for people to walk so they don't walk directly on the river-rock covering ag pipe. We'll see if that works.



### May 12

We've been having quite a bit of heavy rain, which has brought a real problem with flooding in the front of the house into focus. The key issue is that standing water affects the concrete slab foundation, and is likely also responsible for the bamboo wood floor mold near the window, although that needs further research. 

The trench was shallow at first, just down to the weed mat - and then we were blessed with some incredibly heavy rainfall. Made a quick-n-dirty :ref:`video of the rain here <vids-storm-draining>`.

Keeping slope in mind, a massive effort ensued to continue the trench along side the house and all the way down to where the property slopes off markedly towards the back. Drainage pipe was placed in the ground, with a close eye on slope, with the outlet right by the lemon tree. I hope I don't end up drowning it:

![Image](https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/garden/Ak-SHTrench2.jpg)

I do hope the rain will come this arvo as promised and test the drainage pipe I've put in so far:

![Image](https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/garden/Ak-SHTrench3.jpg)



### October 6

Bit of a gap in this blog: working on the footpath during the rains - digging trenches for the runoff ag-pipe and carting off debris to the bottom of our little property has rsulted in a fairly significant back injury which kind-of put things on hold for a bit. Months later, I'm finally able - cautiously and slowly - to start work again on the frame for under the shadehouse, which itself is not the one I originally thought of putting in: it's a `store-bought one <https://www.vidaxl.com.au/e/vidaxl-greenhouse-anthracite-aluminium-3.61-m2/8719883813943.html>`_:

![Image](https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/garden/Am-ShadeHouse1.jpg)

During the unpacking, I've already identified a few issues: not really impressed with quality of materials. Oh well, we're committed... it will just have to do.

The foundation consists of fence-post timber protected with Timber-Protecta. The base dimensions are 190cm by 190cm: 

![Image](https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/garden/Am-ShadeHouse2.jpg)

easy enough to support on three sides: the fourth, I'll have to get a bit creative: I'll cobble something together, use up what we have.

In the meantime, we're getting into the whole permaculture thing in a more thoughtful way. Since Julia and I are both retired, we can focus our energies on doing this properly. Here are a couple of videos that are getting us started:

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uqwWdranB5A" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<hr style="height:2px;border-width:1;color:gray;background-color:gray">



A [full video collection](https://www.youtube.com/embed/uqwWdranB5A) on the subject goes into more detail on what exactly is at stake, and the approaches being proposed under the "permaculture" umbrella. Geoff Lawton has an additional perspective:

<hr style="height:2px;border-width:1;color:gray;background-color:gray">

We still need sheds building: waiting for Annie (next door neighbour) to finish sorting out the whole covenant issue. Meanwhile, got the chook house ready for new occupants: the roof interior had mostly rotted and so we replaced that with a plastic liner for now. I anticipate having to replace the entire roof structure at some juncture. 

Crucial to note here is what I'm observing as to my stamina: that injury setback has really undermined my ability to "bounce back". I'm going to have to take a far more measured approach.



### October 7

Whilst this isn't so much about the shadehouse/greenhouse, Julia is picking up six more "rescue hens" this weekend, so the push was on to get the henhouse ready. The house was built of fairly ordinary quality material, so in time due to moisture leaking through the roof timber, the ceiling had totally rotted out (under the roof). We decided that - for now - we would replace that rotted plywood with a plastic liner:

![Image](https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/garden/Am-ChookHouse04.jpg)

should keep the girls dry this year, which promises to be a rather wet year. I'll probably need to come up with a more robust, permanent solution as even the roof bits will likely rot in time and will need to be replaced. Yes, the house is "cute", but buyer beware: it wasn't built to last, by any stretch of the imagination. I reckon the shadehouse isn't much better.

<hr style="height:8px;border-width:4;color:gray;background-color:gray">







## Footpath over The Storm Drain

### May 17

The house featured a footpath around the right side (facing from the street) of the house. As it was in some disrepair, we had it worked on a few years back. Sadly, rain and poor design rather quickly took the footpath back to a state of disrepair:

![Image](https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/fp/Fp21May17x01.jpg)

Only barely visible in the image (because of the weeds) the retaining timber was broken, of which a portion was actually sticking up: this was a bit of a hazard:

![Image](https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/fp/Fp21May17x02.jpg)

![Image](https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/fp/Fp21May17x03.jpg)

W have a 'Hill's Hoist' at the back of the house. Walking on the footpath to peg washing caused it to deteriorate: we ended up with a total disaster:

![Image](https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/fp/Fp21May17x04.jpg)

The design was not up to the challenge, resulting in sagging retaining timber:

![Image](https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/fp/Fp21May17x06.jpg)

The worst part was that the pumice-gravel would stick to my shoes, which tracked into the house, risking scratching our bamboo flooring.




### May 27

IThe project began with tearing out the rotten timber and sifted out the pumice-like gravel, rescuing what could be saved of the original river-rock:

![Image](https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/fp/Fp21May27x07.jpg)

then raked down the crusher-dust under this rock-gravel mix. This stuff was contaminated with dirt, which is a perfect medium for growing weeds. The evidence lay in the front garden bed area that weeds would not grow if the river-rock was deep enough (weeds need water, growth medium and light to grow) so removing this dirty crusher dust was a crucial first step.

The replacement timber was essentially treated fence posts: these were painted with two coats of Timber Protecta (to prevent rot) prior to placement. To prevent any sagging from the river-rock weight and walking, a sort of angle-cut support 2x8 pieces (also Timber-Protecta-coated) were screwed to the bottom of each retaining timber, as in the image:

![Image](https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/fp/Fp21Jul04x01.jpg)

The reason I thought it a good idea to attach those short, base 2 x 8 pieces diagonally was in order to have a maximum of rock-holding capacity the attached retaining timber erect (to prevent the inevitable sagging with time and usage). We'll see if it works, longterm.

At the corner of the house, the retaining timber lengths are joined together with long stove bolts. Most of the lengths are arranged edge-to-edge and held together with metal plates on the inside of the timber:

![Image](https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/fp/Fp22Apr25x05.jpg)

so that on the outside of the retaining timber, all that is visible are bolts:

![Image](https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/fp/Fp22Apr25x04.jpg)

As is clearly noticable, I purchased the timber from a rather dodgy mob in Cleveland, who refused to let me select the better pieces. They delivered - I don't have a ute - and I reckon they expressly chose the dodgier pieces. Anyway, never mind, I made do. They will remain nameless (rhymes with "Bill") : buyer beware, nevertheless.

A lot of that timber had sappy knots and other defects, some which were so bad I had to trim them off before I painted them with three coats of `Timber Protecta <https://www.bowens.com.au/p/diggers-eco-in-ground-timber-protecta/>`_. The remaining timber still had some warping wich made the edge-joins less than perfect. I reckon with time this slight problem will become less noticable. 




### April 22

Finally recommencing work on this project as I'm now retired and can focus on it. I started on the garden-bed area for the shadehouse which is next to the footpath which has river-rock that needs filtering / cleaning and well, that opened a can of worms. so it's going here:

![Image](https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/fp/FP22Apr22x1.jpg)

The pieces were warped when I bought them - got them for a decent price but they didn't let me select which ones I wanted. Won't be buying from that mob again. Overall, they look okay... up close, the flaws are more evident. I had already placed these timber pieces, but hadn't "tied" them together. They did sink a bit with all the rain we've been having so I had to do a bit of adjusting:

![Image](https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/fp/FP22Apr22x5.jpg)

So, now the river-rock rescued from the front has a place to go. I'll be filling most of the "cavity" with rescued river-rock, and have just a layer at the top surrounding the flagstones of freshly-purchased rock.



### June 10

I can totally tell I'm approaching 70. Progress is slow... much slower than I'd like, but oh well. 

I might, at this juncture, go a bit into what I am trying to accomplish, and why. Here's an idea what the footpath is meant to look like when it's done:

![Image](https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/fp/FP22May04x1.jpg)

And here is what it looked like a year ago:

![Image](https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/fp/Fp21May17x01.jpg)

The main challenge with the use of crusher-dust and pumice-gravel was that weeds would pretty much grow right through, and ultimately take over the footpath. As soon as dust accumulates in the pumice-gravel, it sinks down to the crusher-dust level, giving what should be an inert mineral base into a substrate for weed growth. Additionally, the person that Julia had engaged to redo the footpaths thought putting down *cardboard* - as in: container boxes - under the gravel as a weed deterrent was a good idea (it wasn't: cardboard breaks down quickly, and weeds aren't picky what they grow in) and chose that horrid pumic-gravel to cover the existing river-rock. I've been trying to filter out the river-rock to reuse it: not a trival task. I have been able to demonstrate that if the river-rock layer is deep enough, weeds will not grow:

![Image](https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/fp/FP22Jun11x1.jpg)

![Image](https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/fp/FP22Jun11x2.jpg)

whereas, that pumice-gravel, even with river-rock underneath it and weedmat, allowed weeds to grow. I'm all for weeds, but do want to control where they grow:

![Image](https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/fp/FP22Jun11x4.jpg)

We tried spraying with a vinegar/salt/dish-soap mixture to control the weeds - we have bees, so we're not about to use a off-the-shelf herbicide - and as for the most part it works easily as well as the toxic stuff, it is not a long-term solution.



### July 4

Here's where things ended up in June/July (other projects were demanding my attention):

![Image](https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/fp/Fp21Jun03x04.jpg)

And so things stayed for nine months or so. Work (like, at the hospital) sort-of gets in the way.




### September 6

I have neglected these pages for the past months as projects piled up and updating pages took less and less priority. However, circumstances have changed, which have resulted in forcing me to put physical work on hold... in order to heal.

Long story short: my twenty-five year old brain was dictating utter nonsense to my now seventy year old body, the one with bulging L5-S1 discs and degenerative processes, and because I pushed myself, I am now paying the price. I've developed a bad sciatica for which even a CT-guided nerve-root injection hasn't sort-of done much yet (well, it's early days). End result: forced rest.
