# Other Projects

## Update Log

Update 2025.08.24: In my previous Sphinx-based help files - reminding myself how to do techie and other stuff - I had a 'Projects' site and a 'Help Yourself' site. I'm merging the two to just 'Projects.'

---

Update 2025.08.21: Migrating 'Projects' site from AllHelp (ReST) to markdown (MkDocs), hosted on Cloudflare, with data githubbed then pages created dynamically in Cloudflare. This decision was taken as Tightbytes.com as a Wordpress website was costing a fortune (USD#359.00 / 48 months) which can't be justified. So, once my subscription with Hostinger expires in 2027.12.09, I will not renew, and all pages except the main wordpress page will have been migrated. Still not sure what to do about that.  
There will be subdomains for the Help (and other) pages: projects.tightbytes.com, art.projects.com, appmgr.tightbytes.com, keys2life.tightbytes.com and so on.
