# GIMP Tips

## Overview

Emily: Hey Robyn! Yep—there are a few solid paths to “de-ridge” a brow before you train a LoRA. Here’s what works well without wrecking identity or skin texture.

### Pixel Retouch

**Photoshop / GIMP**

**Goal:** soften the supraorbital ridge (above the eye sockets) while keeping pores & hair intact.

* **Liquify (Face-Aware helps)**

  * Convert layer to **Smart Object** (non-destructive).
  * **Filter ▸ Liquify** → use **Forward Warp** with a **large, soft brush**, low pressure (5–15%).
  * Nudge the ridge **inward/upward** a few pixels; also **raise outer brow tail** slightly to create a gentler arc.
  * If available, **Face-Aware Liquify**: tweak **Brow Height** ↑ a touch and **Brow Tilt** for a softer shape.

* **Dodge/Burn to kill the “ridge” shadows**

  * New blank layer set to **Soft Light**; paint with **low-opacity** black/white.
  * **Dodge (midtones)** the shadow just under the ridge; **Burn (highlights)** lightly on the upper forehead to flatten contrast.

* **Frequency Separation (texture safety net)**

  * Run FS (8–12 px blur radius usually fine for forehead).
  * Do contour tweaks on the **low-freq** (color/volume) layer; leave the **high-freq** (pores) layer untouched so skin stays real.

* **Finish**

  * Heal/clone any wiggles on the brow edge.
  * Tiny **High-Pass (Overlay, 0.7–1.2 px)** pass if you lost snap.

> **Batching:** record an **Action** (Liquify + Dodge/Burn steps at light strength) and run **File ▸ Automate ▸ Batch** so the whole set gets the same treatment—consistency matters for LoRA.

### ComfyUI inpaint

**Keep Identity**

**Goal:** small structural rewrite via diffusion, but locked to the same face.

* **Nodes (one good recipe):**

  * **SDXL (or your base)** + **IP-Adapter FaceID** (or **InstantID**) with a clean reference of the same person.
  * Create a **tight mask** over the ridge & a sliver of forehead (avoid eyebrows/hairline).
  * **Inpaint** with **denoise 0.18–0.30**, **CFG 4–6**, **25–35 steps**.
  * Prompt nudge: *“soft forehead, smooth supraorbital area, subtle brow arc, natural skin texture”*. Put **“prominent brow ridge, heavy brow, bossing”** in **negative**.
  * If needed, run **FaceDetailer** *only on the masked region* (don’t let it rework the whole face).

> **Tip:** Keep the mask narrow. Multiple light passes beat one heavy pass (identity stays truer).

### Re-shoot Sources

Soft **frontal fill** (big diffuser) plus a slight **top fill** kills the shadow band that makes a ridge look harsher. Even 3–5 cleaner sources mixed into the set can steer training.

### Dataset-Training Guardrails

* **Be consistent.** Don’t mix heavily edited with totally unedited; apply the same light treatment across all.
* **Curation beats correction.** Prefer angles/lighting that minimize the ridge.
* **Captions:** include a style token like *“soft brow”*; and during **inference** always negative-prompt *“prominent brow ridge”*.
* **Don’t overdo geometry.** Big warps can drift identity; small, repeatable moves are safer.

### Quick QC checklist

* Zoom 100%—pores intact? brow hair edges clean?
* Profile/¾ view still reads as the same person?
* No banding/flatness on the forehead?
* Apply identical tweaks across the batch.

If you want, tell me which route you’ll use (Photoshop/GIMP vs. ComfyUI inpaint), and I’ll jot a precise mini-workflow with settings tailored to your tools.







## GIMP Specific


Perfect—GIMP can do this cleanly and non-destructively. Here’s a practical, repeatable workflow tuned for softening/removing a prominent brow ridge while preserving pores and identity.

### Quick win

(10–15 min per image)

**Goal:** small geometry nudge + contrast flattening, without plastic skin.

1. **Prep**

* Open the image → **Duplicate the background** (Ctrl/Cmd-Shift-D).
* Name it `01–Warp`. Keep the original hidden for A/B checks.

2. **Subtle shape tweak (Warp Transform)**

* **Tools ▸ Transform Tools ▸ Warp Transform** (W).
* Mode: **Move Pixels**; **Deform radius** large (150–300 px), **Strength** low (0.02–0.08).
* With a very soft cursor, **nudge the ridge inward/up a few pixels**. Work symmetrically and *tiny*. Toggle the eye icon to compare with the original often.

3. **Flatten the ridge shadow (Dodge/Burn on a tone layer)**

* New layer: **Layer ▸ New ▸ Fill with: Transparency**. Name `02–Tone`.
* Set its **Mode = Soft light**; **Opacity ~10–20%**.
* Select the **Paintbrush** (B), low flow/opacity (10–15%).

  * Foreground **white** = lighten. Lightly **paint under the ridge** to lift the shadow band.
  * Foreground **black** = darken. Feather a touch **above the ridge** so highlight isn’t popping forward.
* If you prefer tools: **Dodge/Burn Tool** (Shift-D), **Range = Midtones**, **Exposure 5–10%**; but the Soft-light brush is more controllable.

4. **Edge cleanup**

* **Heal Tool** (H), small brush, sample nearby skin to fix any wobbly edges you introduced near the brow.
* Avoid the eyebrow hairs; if you touch them, **Clone Tool** (C) with aligned sample, 30–50% opacity, single strokes along hair direction.

5. **Micro-contrast snap (optional)**

* Merge a **visible copy** (Shift-Ctrl/Cmd-C then **Edit ▸ Paste as ▸ New Layer**) and name it `03–Snap`.
* **Filters ▸ Enhance ▸ High Pass** (Radius 0.7–1.2 px). Mode **Overlay** or **Soft light**, lower opacity to taste (10–30%). Mask it out everywhere except forehead/brow if needed.

6. **A/B and mask control**

* If anything looks overdone, add a **Layer Mask (White—full opacity)** to `01–Warp` or `02–Tone` and softly paint **black** on the mask to ease back specific spots.

### Pro, texture-safe

**This method  is the Wavelet/“frequency” approach**

**Goal:** change shape/volume on low frequencies while preserving pores perfectly.

1. **Wavelet Decompose**

* On the original image: **Filters ▸ Enhance ▸ Wavelet decompose…**

  * **Scales:** 5–7 is plenty for faces.
  * Keep “Create group” checked.
* You’ll get a group with layers: `Residual` (low-freq volume) + several `Scale N` (high-freq detail).

2. **Volume sculpt on Residual**

* Inside the wavelet group, select **Residual**.
* **Warp Transform** (W) with a *large, soft* brush and very low strength (0.02–0.06), **nudge the ridge** as before. Because you’re on Residual, **pores/hairs stay intact** on the higher scales.

3. **Shadow band fix at the right frequency**

* Still on **Residual**, add a **Layer Mask** (white).
* Create a new layer **above Residual** but *inside the group*, set **Mode = Soft light**, name `Residual–Tone`.
* Lightly paint white under the ridge / black above it to flatten contrast (same as the quick method), or use **Dodge/Burn Tool** on Residual with **Midtones 5–10%**.
* If fine “creases” remain, hop to **Scale 2 or 3** and very gently blur or heal just along the crease line:

  * **Select Scale 2 (or 3)** → **Filters ▸ Blur ▸ Gaussian Blur** (0.5–1.0 px) **on a masked selection** of the crease, or use **Heal** to break the micro-shadow line.

4. **Global sanity**

* Collapse/close the Wavelet group eye icon to compare A/B.
* If the forehead looks “too flat,” reduce **Residual–Tone** opacity first, then ease the Warp mask.

5. **Commit for export**

* **Duplicate the Wavelet group** (for safety), then **Layer ▸ New from Visible** to produce a clean, flattened result for saving. Keep your layered file as the master.

### Consistency

**for LoRA datasets**

* **Do every image the same way:** duplicate background → warp (tiny) → tone layer → (optional) wavelet cleanup. Consistency > perfection.
* **Angles:** prefer frontal/half-frontal, soft frontal fill light; avoid harsh top-down lighting that re-casts the shadow band.
* **Don’t over-flatten:** a hint of natural brow is good. Over-smoothing can drift identity in training.

---

### Handy Settings & Tips

**(GIMP specific)**

* **Brush settings:** Hardness 0.00; dynamics off; **Force/Opacity ~10–15%** for painting. Use a **big brush**—let softness do the work.
* **Warp Transform**: If you see ripples, lower **Strength** first; then increase **Deform radius** rather than pushing harder.
* **Masks are your safety net:** If anything goes “plastic,” paint black on the mask to bring back original texture locally.
* **Batching:** GIMP doesn’t have Photoshop-style Actions, but you can speed up with saved **Tool Presets** (Dockable Dialogs ▸ Tool Options ▸ Save) and, if you later need true batching, consider the **BIMP** plugin or a small Script-Fu for uniform tone-layer creation.

---

### Export checklist

* Save a layered **.XCF** master.
* Export training images as **PNG** or high-quality **JPEG (95–100)**, sRGB.
* Keep EXIF consistent if you’re tracking sources.








## Checklist

### 2-minute version (one gentle pass)

1. **Duplicate layer** → name `01–Warp`.
2. **Warp Transform (Move Pixels)**: Radius 200–300, Strength 0.03–0.05, super-soft brush.

   * One or two tiny nudges to the ridge (inward/up). Stop early.
3. **New layer** `02–Tone` (Mode **Soft light**, Opacity ~15%).

   * Paint **white** lightly under the ridge (lifts shadow).
   * Paint **black** very lightly above it (tames highlight).
4. **Layer Mask** on `01–Warp` or `02–Tone` if anything feels overdone.
5. **Save** as `.XCF` (keep layers), then **Export** your PNG/JPEG.

### What “good enough” looks like

* The ridge shadow is less banded, but pores and brow hairs still read.
* The forehead curve looks a touch rounder—not flat.
* A/B toggle doesn’t scream “edit,” it just feels softer.

### Safety rails

* If you see plastic skin: lower `02–Tone` opacity first; then paint black on its mask to ease back.
* If you see ripples: undo, drop **Strength**, increase **Radius**, try again.
* If you lose brow hair edges: fix with **Heal/Clone** at 30–40% opacity, strokes following hair direction.

### When you’re ready for “pro mode” (later)

* **Wavelet Decompose (5–7 scales)** → nudge only on **Residual**, do micro shadow fixes on **Scale 2–3**. This preserves pores perfectly, but don’t rush it.

### Make a reusable template

* Set up an `.XCF` with:

  * Background (your image)
  * `01–Warp` (empty)
  * `02–Tone` (Soft light, 15%)
* Open each new photo, **drag them into the template**, and repeat the same micro steps. Consistency = better LoRA.

If you want, describe one photo’s angle/lighting and I’ll recommend exact Warp radius/strength and how much to paint on `02–Tone` so you have a concrete starting point.
