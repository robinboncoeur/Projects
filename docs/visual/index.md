# Art & Video

## Intro

The visual medium has come a long way: it is very easy, even to some degree **inexpensive**, to be creative in video and image generation. 3D modeling has been almost completely replaced by artificial intelligence models. Video is quick, immediate and of decent quality coming from a phone.

Crazy times.
