<p>I use a 3D software called <a class="reference external" href="https://www.blender.org/">Blender</a> - <strong>completely</strong> free software, mind you, download, install, PLAY! - to help visualise some ideas I had for this shadehouse:</p>
<img alt="https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/garden/Aa-SHStart01.jpg" src="https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/garden/Aa-SHStart01.jpg" />
<p>Note on 22.Apr.25: <em>the more I’ve been working on and thinking about the design, the more I realise that it’s probably not practical to have a gabled roof of the type in that image. Perhaps a lean-to approach might be more useful</em>.</p>
<p>Started with: removal of all the gardening stuff (pots and tools and soil in bags and clay marbles for hydroponics and on and on, endless collection of stuff over the years!) that had accumulated over time - washed anything that looked useful; if not, it got thrown - and dismantled the bed furthest from the camera:</p>
<img alt="https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/garden/Aa-SHStart02.jpg" src="https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/garden/Aa-SHStart02.jpg" />
<p>When the decking came up, I became aware of something I’d sort-of suspected for some time: there was a real problem with wood breakdown. Rot. The floor frame (under the planking) had terrible rot issues. The foundation will have to be replaced:</p>
<img alt="https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/garden/Aa-SHStart03.jpg" src="https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/garden/Aa-SHStart03.jpg" />
<p>I will extend the foundation to the front fence. Also, the <a class="reference external" href="https://jag.net.au/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/AG-WITH-SOCK-3.jpg">ag pipe</a> that deals with storm rain-water in the front yard was directed to the frame and - worse yet - the neighbour’s fence. It will need to be re-routed to our back yard. Hours and hours of back-breaking work ahead!</p>

<h3>SH-2022.Apr.20<a class="headerlink" href="#sh-2022-apr-20" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>You know how when you start getting into a project, it sort-of just grows? We’ve been having problems with standing water in our front yard during heavy downpours. Whilst the house is built on a slab, we’re seeing cracks develop where they just shouldn’t. Some time ago we’d engaged some gardening dudes to put down some ag pipe to drain off that water. That ag pipe:</p>
<img alt="https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/garden/Ab-SHBase01.jpg" src="https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/garden/Ab-SHBase01.jpg" />
<p>… yep, those two back plasic pipes are humped over the watertank overflow. Not going to work, is it? Water has issues running uphill, I’ve been told.</p>
<p>here’s where it used to empty into, towards the mattock (pick) and the neighbour’s fence:</p>
<img alt="https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/garden/Ab-SHBase02.jpg" src="https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/garden/Ab-SHBase02.jpg" />
<p>At the bottom of this bed, I’m going to have to reinforce the bottom of the side to keep the soil seeping out - those logs are doing a piss-poor job of holding the soil the the bed:</p>
<img alt="https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/garden/Ab-SHBase03.jpg" src="https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/garden/Ab-SHBase03.jpg" />
<p>Actually have a bit of time to update this page as we’re have a young visitor - Harriet! - and gave myself the excuse that it was too warm to work on it today. However, it cooled down nicely, and after doing a bit of “blue-ing” on rusty stuff I’m trying to “resurrect”, I finally got stuck into it and finished pulling the dead stuff out:</p>
<img alt="https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/garden/Ab-SHBase09.jpg" src="https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/garden/Ab-SHBase09.jpg" />

<h3>SH-2022.Apr.23<a class="headerlink" href="#sh-2022-apr-23" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>A lot of soil has been “bleeding” out from under the beds. I retrieved over a wheelbarrow-full during this exercise. Some of the beds sinking can probably be attributed to that, the rest, probably the decomposition of the biomass we cover with soil. So, I’ve placed some ‘sacrifical’ pieces where a log lived, before:</p>
<img alt="https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/garden/Ah-SHBase1.jpg" src="https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/garden/Ah-SHBase1.jpg" />
<p>‘Sacrificial’, because another piece is going to live outboard to that:</p>
<img alt="https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/garden/Ah-SHBase5.jpg" src="https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/garden/Ah-SHBase5.jpg" />
<p>…a piece that I’ve painted in Timber-Protecta, and I sort-of want to minimise contact with soil and this anti-rot paint.</p>
<p>In the ShadeHouse area, I’ve spread the torn shade sail - which we had to replace:</p>
<img alt="https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/garden/Ah-SHBase4.jpg" src="https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/garden/Ah-SHBase4.jpg" />
<p>…all in an effort of discouraging weed growth and reducing waste (those shade-sails would have ended up in landfill):</p>
<img alt="https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/garden/Ah-SHBase8.jpg" src="https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/garden/Ah-SHBase8.jpg" />
<p>And now, the hard bit: ‘rescuing’ the river rock mixed in with this nasty pumice-gravel, gravel which will end up under the ShadeHouse foundation.</p>

<p>And why do all this? For the cuccumbers</p>
<img alt="https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/garden/Ab-SHBase05.jpg" src="https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/garden/Ab-SHBase05.jpg" />
<p>and parsley</p>
<img alt="https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/garden/Ab-SHBase04.jpg" src="https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/garden/Ab-SHBase04.jpg" />
<p>and echallots (spring onions):</p>
<img alt="https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/garden/Ab-SHBase08.jpg" src="https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/garden/Ab-SHBase08.jpg" />
<p>When you buy echallots here in Oz, get generally get the complete plant: roots and all. I have found that if you cut off the bottom bit (leaving about 2 inches or so) you can stick these bottom bits into the ground and they will grow into full, healthy plants.</p>
<p>Using this approach, we used to have tons of spring onions! almost never had to buy any for quite a while. Lately, though, these stumps I planted never seemed to survive longer than a night or so. We finally figured it’s likely a rat or a possum having a midnight snack.</p>
<p>So, we’re going to try this approach - protecting the stumps until they get going growing - to give the plant a change at successful growth by keeping it covered.</p>
<p>Indeed, I’ll probably have to take this approach with any seedlings. I’d planted a whole bunch of broccoli and beetroot seedlings and the whole lot got decimated by some critter. Very frustrating!</p>
<p>We’ll see how we go.</p>

<p>We had the footpath around the house worked on a few years back. Sadly, rain and wear-and-tear (and probably also poor design) left things looking a bit worse for wear:</p>
<img alt="https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/garden/Ad-Before01.jpg" src="https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/garden/Ad-Before01.jpg" />
<p>the retaining timber was actually sticking up (somewhat hidden by the grass) and was a bit of a hazard:</p>
<img alt="https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/garden/Ad-Before02.jpg" src="https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/garden/Ad-Before02.jpg" />
<img alt="https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/garden/Ad-Before03.jpg" src="https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/garden/Ad-Before03.jpg" />
<p>and the back of the house had turned into a total disaster:</p>

<h3>FP-2021.May.27<a class="headerlink" href="#fp-2021-may-27" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>I tore out the rotten timber and sifted out the pumice-like gravel, rescuing what I could of the original river-rock:</p>
<img alt="https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/garden/Ae-FPBegin1.jpg" src="https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/garden/Ae-FPBegin1.jpg" />
<p>then raked down the crusher-dust under this rock-gravel mix. This stuff was contaminated with dirt, so a perfect medium for growing weeds. I had the evidence from my front garden bed area that weeds will not grow if the river-rock is deep enough so removing this dirty crusher dust was crucial. The replacement timber was painted with two coats of Timber Protecta (to prevent rot) prior to placement:</p>
<img alt="https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/garden/Ae-FPBegin4.jpg" src="https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/garden/Ae-FPBegin4.jpg" />
<p>The timber lengths are joined together thus:</p>
<img alt="https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/garden/Af-FPBegin12.jpg" src="https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/garden/Af-FPBegin12.jpg" />
<p>and each length was bolted to a piece of treated timber to prevent sagging in the future:</p>
<img alt="https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/garden/Ag-FPBegin1.jpg" src="https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/garden/Ag-FPBegin1.jpg" />
<p>The reason I thought it a good idea to attach it diagonally was in order to have a maximum of rock holding the piece down (surface-area thing). We’ll see if it works, longterm.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="fp-2021-jul-04">
<h3>FP-2021.Jul.04<a class="headerlink" href="#fp-2021-jul-04" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>Here’s where things ended up in July (other projects were demanding my attention):</p>
<img alt="https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/garden/Ag-FPBegin8.jpg" src="https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/garden/Ag-FPBegin8.jpg" />
<img alt="https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/garden/Ag-FPBegin9.jpg" src="https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/garden/Ag-FPBegin9.jpg" />
<p>And so things stayed for nine months or so.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="fp-2022-apr-22">
<h3>FP-2022.Apr.22<a class="headerlink" href="#fp-2022-apr-22" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>Finally making a bit of headway, basically because the garden-bed area I’m working on (for the shadehouse) has river-rock that needs a new home, so it’s going here:</p>
<img alt="https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/garden/Ah-FPCont1.jpg" src="https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/garden/Ah-FPCont1.jpg" />
<p>I had already placed these timber pieces, but hadn’t “tied” them together, and they did sink a bit with all the rain we’ve been having:</p>
<img alt="https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/garden/Ah-FPCont5.jpg" src="https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/garden/Ah-FPCont5.jpg" />
<p>So, now they are all level, and the river-rock rescued from the front has a place to go.</p>
