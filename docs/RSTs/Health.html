<p>The death rate from the vaccine (the mRNA vaccines) is about 0.0001%.</p>
<p>The death rate from Covid if you’re not vaccinated is 2%-5% (about 20,000 to 50,000 times worse)</p>
<p>The incidence of long covid if you’re vaccinated is “I haven’t seen any such cases”.</p>
<p>The incidence if you’re not is about 11% who still had symptoms in January 2023 and 28% who have ever had symptoms.</p>
<p>Most people who have been vaccinated report anything from feeling the needle to having a sore upper arm for a day or a couple of days. So overall, it’s not affecting many people.</p>

<h3>Weight-loss Tracking<a class="headerlink" href="#weight-loss-tracking" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>I’d actually started tracking my weight back in November, when I was 113.35 kg (almost 250lbs). Did a dry November which extended into December, had a bit of wine over the holidays and particularly when I retired the first part of January. Julia and I visited some of her Rural Aid volunteers in Eumundi the second weekend in January, after which I stopped all consumption of any fermented (alcoholic) beverages.</p>
<p>The point here wasn’t weight loss: that was going to be incidental. The focus was on liver-cleansing.</p>
<p>In February, I started a spreadsheet in Excel to track my progress. Here’s the first month, February:</p>
<img alt="https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/health/02Feb.png" src="https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/health/02Feb.png" />
<p>At this point, we’d cut back on bread but were still having starch in the form of roast potatoes and sweet potatoes. Towards the end of February, we stopped all those starches as well. Here’s March:</p>
<img alt="https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/health/03Mar.png" src="https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/health/03Mar.png" />
<p>Progress was slow on the weight-loss front. Lots of aches and pains, particularly in the back. And then, Julia went to Orroroo. We both stayed faithful to the plan:</p>
<img alt="https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/health/04Apr.png" src="https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/health/04Apr.png" />
<p>…for the most part. However, there were “breaks from the action”, like days we had fish-n-chips, or kebabs. High in sodium… you can tell from the spikes when this happened:</p>
<img alt="https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/health/05May.png" src="https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/health/05May.png" />
<p>Overall, it <strong>has</strong> been pretty steady (on average). Here’s June so far:</p>

<section id="and-then-this-happened">
<h3>And then, this happened<a class="headerlink" href="#and-then-this-happened" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Here’s a few observations on events that have happened the past few days. First, though, core concepts that I hold as uncontestable:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>We are created beings: thus, we have a creator. He would not recommend anything that would negatively affect our health, mental or physical.</p></li>
<li><p>The world is in decline: what we ingest and our environment is growing increasingly toxic. Which calls for prudence / thoughtfulness / situational awareness.</p></li>
<li><p>Science must be respected, but not revered (i.e., considered gospel). It is not the ultimate truth: though it generally represents the closest thing we have to what we can confirm to be true, based on observation (which is different to faith-based truths).</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>I have been stepping on the scale every morning upon rising. I know: you’re not meant to do that, but it actually tells me a lot. Sudden weight gain or loss - to me, at least - points to fluid retention or loss: one doesn’t accumulate (or lose) adipose rapidly.</p>
<p>So, I ask myself: what causes fluid retention? Lustig indicates in one of his discussions that this can be a result of inflammation. Well, there’s no question I still have significant inflammation, which very recently expressed itself as severe gout (uric acid production = unhappy liver) in the right foot and tenderness in the left knee. For which I finally took Advil and Tylenol and subsequently went from 96.8 to 99.1kg in a matter of days. Both of those meds are hepatotoxic: that I know. The liver deals with toxins: that we know.</p>
<p>That I should have that profound a response (a 2kg fluid weight gain!) tells me a fair bit about the state of my liver, and sets at question what Lustig said about rapid liver function recovery: apparently restoring a liver back to normal is a longer process than he thought.</p>

<h3>Eat for health, longevity and happiness<a class="headerlink" href="#eat-for-health-longevity-and-happiness" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Life expectancy, quality of life and health-span are going down, and not because of Covid. We are witnessing an epidemic of chronic noncommunicable disease (CNDs) (such as diabetes, heart disease and stroke, fatty liver disease, cancer, dementia) as well as mental health issues (addiction, depression, anxiety) and autoimmune conditions which are increasing in prevalence and severity. These diseases of metabolic and mitochondrial dysfunction cannot be helped with a pill, but rather with food. But not just any #food. “Let food be thy medicine” is true only if it is the right food. The wrong food, however, will poison you over time.</p>
<p>Prof. Robert Lustig, paediatric neuro-endocrinologist and best-selling author of “Fat Chance”, advises us to take our health into our own hands in order to dodge the agendas of big food, big pharma, and to an extent, modern doctors who don’t have the time (nor often the knowledge) to teach us about prevention, lifestyle and the power of food to heal.</p>

<h3>Food Tips<a class="headerlink" href="#food-tips" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p><strong>Add Garlic Last</strong></p>
<p>If you enjoy trying new dishes with bold, delicious flavors, you might have noticed a pattern: recipes rarely tell you to toss garlic in a dish first. But why is that?</p>
<p>Garlic is almost always added after you’ve begun cooking other aromatics, like celery and carrots, to prevent it from overcooking or burning.</p>
<p>Those who have cooked with minced garlic before are likely well aware that it burns incredibly fast. Unlike onions, which get a delicious caramelization effect as they cook, overcooked garlic is acrid and not the most savory flavor. Adding garlic after you sauté other ingredients can help prevent that burnt flavor from invading your recipe.</p>
<p>Unlike onions and other aromatics, garlic has less water content which is why it’s so prone to burn. When you start your dish with an ingredient like onions, they release water into the pan. By creating that layer in the pan and then adding garlic, you’ll help prevent burning.</p>
<p>Worried about if cooking your garlic later will mean less garlic flavor? Don’t be. In a test done by Serious Eats, garlic was added to a pan at the same time as onions in one dish, and in another dish, the onions were sauteed first with garlic added second. Turns out, adding garlic to a recipe later actually results in more garlic flavor, not less.</p>
<p>The next time you’re tempted to add your garlic first because you think it’ll boost flavor, think again.</p>

<h3>Note to R Lustig<a class="headerlink" href="#note-to-r-lustig" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>How does one convey the concept that fructose in the absence of fibre is a toxin?</p>
<p>My wife and I both lost over 20kg (each) without trying - i.e., that was not our goal - by just doing real food cooking, eliminating processed food as much as we could… also, her: no sweets, me: very little grog, with extremely rare ‘indulgences’ (allowing exposure to toxins) for the past year.</p>
<p>I now fit into a shirt I haven’t worn since 2003.</p>
<p>And people ask! How did you do it?</p>
<p>The issue, as I see it is that fructose consumption is so normalised in Western Society that to denounce sugar (fructose) as the cause of the problem is invariably met with incredulity. The thought is: sure, you tend to gain weight (a bit) on the stuff, but a <em>toxin</em>?</p>
<p>I point out that sugar (well, fructose) is dealt with in the liver in exactly the same fashion as <em>alcohol</em>. “Really!” {sigh} yes, really.</p>
<p>The real problem is that even scientists <em>you</em> talk to don’t really “get it”.</p>
<p>I did, and eventually, my wife did. And a year later, my ALT is less than 23 (still a bit high end). Other LFTs: pretty much low end. Triglycerides: seriously down from last year (I’m 70, so metabolic disease is a real threat). Removing the exposure <em>WORKS</em>. But, how to share this crucial knowledge without losing folks in the weeds of the science?</p>
<p>The science needs distilling to the lay person’s ability to “get it”. And even for some “medical professionals”.</p>

<section id="chatgpt-s-summary-of-hacking">
<h3>ChatGPT’s Summary of “Hacking”<a class="headerlink" href="#chatgpt-s-summary-of-hacking" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Robert Lustig’s “The Hacking of the American Mind” is a book that explores the impact of modern society’s emphasis on pleasure-seeking and the resulting effects on our health and well-being. Lustig argues that the rise of consumerism, the food industry, and technology have created a culture that promotes the constant pursuit of pleasure, often through the overconsumption of food, drugs, and technology, and that this pursuit of pleasure has led to a decline in our physical and mental health.</p>
<p>Lustig examines the role of two types of pleasure in our lives: “liking” and “wanting.” “Liking” is the feeling of enjoyment we get from pleasurable experiences, such as eating good food or spending time with loved ones. “Wanting” is the desire for more of these pleasurable experiences, even when they are harmful, such as addiction to drugs or overeating.</p>
<p>Lustig argues that the food industry has capitalized on the “wanting” aspect of pleasure by creating addictive, processed foods that stimulate our brain’s reward center and encourage overeating. He also discusses the impact of technology on our brains, including social media and video games, which can provide a constant source of “wanting” pleasure that can be just as addictive as drugs or food.</p>
<p>Lustig suggests that we can improve our health and well-being by focusing on “liking” pleasure rather than “wanting” pleasure, by emphasizing meaningful experiences that provide genuine enjoyment and fulfillment, such as spending time with loved ones, engaging in hobbies, and pursuing personal goals. He also advocates for policy changes that can reduce the influence of consumerism and the food industry on our lives.</p>
<p>Overall, “The Hacking of the American Mind” is a thought-provoking exploration of the impact of pleasure-seeking on our society and our health, and provides valuable insights into how we can improve our lives and our communities.</p>
<p>Robert Lustig discusses the relationship between two neurotransmitters in the brain: dopamine and serotonin.</p>
<p>Dopamine is often referred to as the “reward neurotransmitter” because it is released in response to pleasurable experiences such as eating delicious food, taking drugs, or having sex. Dopamine is associated with the “wanting” aspect of pleasure that drives us to seek out more of these experiences, even when they may not be good for us.</p>
<p>On the other hand, serotonin is often referred to as the “contentment neurotransmitter” because it is associated with feelings of well-being and happiness. Serotonin is released when we engage in behaviors that promote long-term satisfaction, such as forming social connections, pursuing meaningful goals, and engaging in physical activity.</p>
<p>Lustig argues that the modern lifestyle, with its emphasis on instant gratification and constant pleasure-seeking, has disrupted the balance between dopamine and serotonin in our brains. Overstimulation of the dopamine reward system can lead to addiction, anxiety, and depression, while a lack of serotonin can result in feelings of emptiness and dissatisfaction.</p>
<p>Lustig suggests that we can restore this balance by focusing on behaviors that promote the release of serotonin, such as engaging in meaningful relationships, pursuing personal goals, and practicing mindfulness. He also emphasizes the importance of reducing the overstimulation of the dopamine reward system by limiting our exposure to addictive substances and activities, such as processed foods, drugs, and social media.</p>
<p>In summary, Lustig draws a correlation between dopamine and serotonin, arguing that the modern emphasis on dopamine-based pleasure-seeking has disrupted the balance between these two neurotransmitters, which has negative effects on our mental and physical health. He suggests that we can restore this balance by prioritizing behaviors that promote the release of serotonin and limiting our exposure to addictive stimuli.</p>
<p>Robert Lustig provides a bullet-point comparison between dopamine and serotonin, highlighting their differences in function and effects on our brains and bodies. Following is a summary of the comparison.</p>
<p>Dopamine:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>Drives pleasure-seeking behaviors</p></li>
<li><p>Associated with addiction and compulsion</p></li>
<li><p>Activated by short-term, high-intensity stimulation</p></li>
<li><p>Promotes impulsivity and risk-taking behavior</p></li>
<li><p>Associated with stress and anxiety when overstimulated</p></li>
<li><p>Can lead to depression when depleted</p></li>
<li><p>Can be activated by drugs, junk food, and social media</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Serotonin:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>Promotes feelings of contentment and well-being</p></li>
<li><p>Associated with long-term satisfaction and fulfillment</p></li>
<li><p>Activated by behaviors that promote social connection, physical activity, and personal growth</p></li>
<li><p>Promotes impulse control and emotional stability</p></li>
<li><p>Associated with reduced stress and anxiety when activated</p></li>
<li><p>Can lead to depression when depleted</p></li>
<li><p>Can be activated by social connection, physical activity, and mindfulness practices</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Overall, Lustig suggests that a focus on dopamine-based pleasure-seeking, as promoted by modern consumer culture, can lead to imbalances in the brain that negatively affect our mental and physical health. Instead, he advocates for a shift towards behaviors that promote the release of serotonin, such as building meaningful relationships, pursuing personal goals, and engaging in activities that promote physical and mental well-being.</p>

<h3>Proofing Sourdough<a class="headerlink" href="#proofing-sourdough" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>… In the Fridge, by: ALLY</p>
<p>Proofing sourdough in the fridge is a little-known secret that can make your sourdough baking easier and more successful. Learn what proofing is, why you should proof in the fridge, and how long to proof sourdough in the fridge.</p>
<p>You’ve probably heard that proofing your sourdough in the fridge is one of the best ways to make a loaf with an incredible flavor and texture. But what does that mean, exactly? And how do you go about doing it?</p>
<p><strong>What is proofing?</strong></p>
<p>In both regular (yeasted) bread making and sourdough baking, proofing refers to the rise after shaping. During yeasted baking it’s often called the final rise.</p>
<p>During the proofing process, the shaped dough is allowed to rest and rise, usually until it doubles in size. This allows the yeast to do its job and create carbon dioxide gas, stretching the gluten in the dough, and trapping the gas in bubbles within the bread.</p>
<p>This step is critically important for all bread or leavened goods, to give them a light, airy texture, not to mention the flavor! Without proofing, our bread would be flat, dense, and taste bland.</p>
<p><strong>Why proof sourdough in the fridge</strong></p>
<p>In most of my SOURDOUGH RECIPES, I give the option to proof at room temperature for 1-3 hours or place in the fridge for a cold ferment. Whenever I have the option of choosing room temperature or proofing in the fridge, I always choose the fridge!</p>
<p>Proofing sourdough at cold temperatures is often called a cold retard, because it slows down the final rise process.</p>
<p>So why proof sourdough in the fridge?</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p>better flavor:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Dough that has been proofed in the fridge has a more complex, sourer flavor than room temperature proofed dough. When the bread is proofing at room temperature, the dough develops faster than the flavor, by slowing it down and proofing in the fridge, we are allowing the flavor to develop in time with the dough.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This is a direct result of the temperature slowing down the yeast’s fermentation activity, but the bacteria in the starter are less dependent on the temperature and they are able to continue breaking down starches into LACTIC AND ACETIC ACIDS, giving us that sour tang we can’t get enough of!</p>
<ol class="arabic" start="2">
<li><p>easier to handle:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Cold dough is much much easier to handle. It’s easier to flip out of your BANNETON, it’s easier to score, it’s just easier to work with.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Warm dough tends to flatten once turned out of its banneton, giving you less time to flip it, score it, and transfer it to a dutch oven. The lame also tends to stick to the warm dough.</p>
<p>Cold dough is less urgent, it resists spreading for longer, it’s by far easier to score, and because it’s more sturdy, it’s easier to get into your dutch oven!</p>
<ol class="arabic" start="3">
<li><p>adds flexibility:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Sourdough is a process, a process I’ve come to truly enjoy, but it still takes a while.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Allowing your sourdough to cold retard in the fridge puts you back in the driver’s seat when it comes to baking sourdough. Proofing in the fridge extends your proofing window from 1-3 hours to days! You can bake that bread on your schedule, not the dough’s!</p>
<ol class="arabic" start="4">
<li><p>better crust + crumb:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>This one might be splitting hairs a little bit, but a cold fermented dough usually has a superior crust and crumb to a sourdough proofed at room temperature.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Baking cold sourdough tends to give that delicious, blistered crust that’s somehow crispy but also delicate at the same time. It’s 12/10 perfect.</p>
<p>The crumb is better because it takes time for gluten development in the dough especially with recipes that don’t incorporate kneading to speed it up. But this process is not temperature dependant. Allowing the sourdough to proof in the fridge slows the yeast down, allowing gluten development to catch up to the gasses released making for better-leavened bread and crumb.</p>
<p><strong>How to proof sourdough in the fridge</strong></p>
<p>This is the easy part! Follow the recipe as written until you get to the final shaping stage:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>Shape the dough as desired, in a boule or batard. Place the shaped loaf into a BANNETON or banneton alternative.</p></li>
<li><p>Cover the banneton with a plastic shower cap, or slide into a plastic bag.</p></li>
<li><p>Place the covered banneton into the fridge for your desired length of time.</p></li>
<li><p>When ready to bake, simply preheat oven and dutch oven. Once the oven is preheated, you can bake the sourdough straight from the fridge.</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>How long to proof sourdough in the fridge</strong></p>
<p>While there is a wide range of times that your sourdough can be proofed in the fridge and there is no right or wrong answer, keep your cold retard time frame within reason. While a short 2-hour cold ferment will do nothing for the flavor, it can help if you have to pick up the kids from school while you should be baking!</p>
<p>A super-long 84-hour cold retard is probably too long and will result in over-proofed bread that lacks energy for decent oven spring.</p>
<p>I find the sweet spot for me and my starter is 24-48 hours.</p>
<p>This might take some trial and error to nail it down to your liking, but I’d start with 18-24 hours!</p>
<p><strong>My preferences for proofing in the fridge</strong></p>
<p>For this post, I made 2 identical batches of sourdough using my SMALL LOAF SOURDOUGH RECIPE at the same time, everything was done exactly the same, except the proofing time.</p>
<p>My findings may surprise you, but my favourite fridge proofing time, for my starter, is 48 hours. The loaf with the large air pockets was proofed for 24 hours in the fridge and the loaf with the smaller pockets was proofed 48 hours - its crumb was a lot more open than the photos show, it was likely just cut in the worst spot!</p>
<p>In the photo below, the crumb is actually slightly underdeveloped in the loaf with the large air pockets. This was apparent in the texture as well. The longer fermented bread was lighter and airier, in addition to having a more pleasing mildly sour taste, while the 24-hour cold fermented loaf lacked depth and complexity in the flavor.</p>
<p>The 48-hour bread also had a better oven spring and bloomed more at the score, this is apparent in the overhead photos below.</p>
<p>faq</p>
<p>I don’t have a banneton, can I still proof my sourdough in the fridge?</p>
<p>Heck yes! Sourdough is a super adaptable recipe, and I made it for over a year without a banneton. Here’s a list of BANNETON ALTERNATIVES.</p>
<p>Do I need to proof my sourdough in the fridge? Or can I do it at room temperature?</p>
<p>You’re totally able to proof at room temperature, it just occurs quickly, between 1 and 3 hours, usually, so be prepared to bake shortly after the final shaping.</p>
<p>What is cold retard or cold ferment? Are they the same?</p>
<p>A cold retard is simply the act of proofing your sourdough bread at cold temperatures (around 34f). Because the low temperature slows the yeast activity in the dough, it is called retarding. Cold fermenting and cold retarding are two different names for the same process.</p>
<p>The slowed fermentation rate is why I recommend STORING YOUR SOURDOUGH STARTER in the fridge if you’re an infrequent baker!</p>
<p>Should I cover my dough during a cold ferment?</p>
<p>Absolutely! Please cover your dough. Use a dedicated shower cap or even a recycled bread bag! The fridge can be a very drying place, due to the forced air inside to keep the temperature constant, this will dry out your bread and affect its oven spring and potentially ruin that irresistible crust!</p>
<p>When should I be putting my dough into the fridge for the cold retard?
As soon as you’ve finished shaping the dough and placing it into its banneton or rising bowl, cover it up, and chuck it in the fridge! The longer the dough is left at room temperature, the longer the yeast has to consume the flour and the more likely that the dough will over-proof.</p>
<p>So pop it into the fridge as soon as the final shape is done!</p>
<p>Will my sourdough double in size if it’s cold fermented?</p>
<p>It will not! But don’t be fooled, that doesn’t mean that it won’t puff up during baking. The cold temperature of the fridge slows down the yeast so the bacteria in the bread have time to work and create sour flavors while the gluten develops. Your bread will still rise beautifully and have a great oven spring because the yeast hasn’t consumed all the available food, they’ll reactivate during the baking process.</p>
