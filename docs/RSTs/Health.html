<p>I’d actually started tracking my weight back in November, when I was 113.35 kg (almost 250lbs). Did a dry November which extended into December, had a bit of wine over the holidays and particularly when I retired the first part of January. Julia and I visited some of her Rural Aid volunteers in Eumundi the second weekend in January, after which I stopped all consumption of any fermented (alcoholic) beverages.</p>
<p>The point here wasn’t weight loss: that was going to be incidental. The focus was on liver-cleansing.</p>
<p>In February, I started a spreadsheet in Excel to track my progress. Here’s the first month, February:</p>
<img alt="https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/health/02Feb.png" src="https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/health/02Feb.png" />
<p>At this point, we’d cut back on bread but were still having starch in the form of roast potatoes and sweet potatoes. Towards the end of February, we stopped all those starches as well. Here’s March:</p>
<img alt="https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/health/03Mar.png" src="https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/health/03Mar.png" />
<p>Progress was slow on the weight-loss front. Lots of aches and pains, particularly in the back. And then, Julia went to Orroroo. We both stayed faithful to the plan. Here’s April so far:</p>

<h3>Food Tips<a class="headerlink" href="#food-tips" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p><strong>*Add Garlic Last</strong></p>
<p>If you enjoy trying new dishes with bold, delicious flavors, you might have noticed a pattern: recipes rarely tell you to toss garlic in a dish first. But why is that?</p>
<p>Garlic is almost always added after you’ve begun cooking other aromatics, like celery and carrots, to prevent it from overcooking or burning.</p>
<p>Those who have cooked with minced garlic before are likely well aware that it burns incredibly fast. Unlike onions, which get a delicious caramelization effect as they cook, overcooked garlic is acrid and not the most savory flavor. Adding garlic after you sauté other ingredients can help prevent that burnt flavor from invading your recipe.</p>
<p>Unlike onions and other aromatics, garlic has less water content which is why it’s so prone to burn. When you start your dish with an ingredient like onions, they release water into the pan. By creating that layer in the pan and then adding garlic, you’ll help prevent burning.</p>
<p>Worried about if cooking your garlic later will mean less garlic flavor? Don’t be. In a test done by Serious Eats, garlic was added to a pan at the same time as onions in one dish, and in another dish, the onions were sauteed first with garlic added second. Turns out, adding garlic to a recipe later actually results in more garlic flavor, not less.</p>
<p>The next time you’re tempted to add your garlic first because you think it’ll boost flavor, think again.</p>

<p>Wonder why counting calories doesn’t work? Maybe because ‘a calorie is NOT a calorie’?
Here’s why:
a. It’s not what you eat, it’s what you absorb.
b. It’s not what you absorb, it’s what you metabolize.
c. It’s not what you metabolize, but how much ATP you make.
d. It’s not what you exercise, it’s what you burn.
e. It’s not what you burn, it’s how many ATP vs. heat your mitochondria partition, both at rest and during exercise.
You think you can count those? If so, I’ve got a bridge to sell you….</p>
