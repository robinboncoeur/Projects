<h2>My Projects Pages<a class="headerlink" href="#my-projects-pages" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>I was trying to upload images to an email I was sending to Martin and Esther on 2022-Apr-15. Got about halfway through and Gmail told me I would exceed the size limit (25mb). Which seems silly in this day and age: this was without trying to send a video, even. Just pictures.</p>
<p>What appeals to me about doing project progress sharing this way is:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>I can share a LOT of information no-cost</p></li>
<li><p>The information is hidden in obscurity of “no-one gives a rat’s nether-regions about what I’m doing”. <em>Just have a look at my website:</em> <a class="reference external" href="https://www.tightbytes.com/">Tightbytes.com</a>. <em>Visitors? none</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>Updating is a lot quicker on GitHub than on Tightbytes: I edit locally, then use Github Desktop to manage the update to my pages.</p></li>
<li><p>Since the pages are hosted on GitHub, other family and friends could collaborate on this pages, and even add pages of their own.</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Some sections use dates as a sort-of link key. For example, I’ll give whoever I’m writing an email to, as a link, the current entry into a given project page, like so:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p><a class="reference external" href="https://robinboncoeur.github.io/Projects/RSTs/Garden.html#apr-23">https://robinboncoeur.github.io/Projects/RSTs/Garden.html#apr-23</a></p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Sphinx is really cool that way! By the way, the images have been uniformly resized (for the most part) to 1024 x 768 pixels. They are not displayed in that resolution, but right-clicking and choosing “Open image in a New Tab…” will display that image in a somewhat larger resolution.</p>
<hr style="height:4px;border-width:0;color:gray;background-color:gray"><section id="a-bit-about-the-why">
<h3>A Bit about the Why<a class="headerlink" href="#a-bit-about-the-why" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>First off, it’s about sharing. That was sort-of my primary motivation for <a class="reference external" href="https://tightbytes.com/">TightBytes</a> - which sees pretty much no visitors … whatever - and is what drives these pages. As you can tell from the next section, a bit of the reason was so I had a centralised location for reminders and links to stuff and so forth. Getting old makes one a bit forgetful, and I’ll sometimes find myself out and about - away from my PC - trying to do something I absolutely <em>Know</em> how to do… yeah, but can’t remember <strong>exactly</strong> how. Perhaps the reason I forget is because I use so many “tools”.</p>
<p>What do I mean by “tools”?</p>
<p>These pages - the one’s on Github, currently (2022) - are created (typed) in a program (free) called “Brackets”. So, not in MS Word or on Notepad or other text editor, but <a class="reference external" href="https://brackets.io/">Brackets</a>. The reason for that is Brackets is a plain-text editor for programmers: it allows you to include text (and other) formatting code to be included in your text. The formatting codes aren’t visible to the person reading the resultant page… thus:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">...</span><span class="n">here</span> <span class="ow">is</span> <span class="n">how</span> <span class="n">I</span> <span class="n">do</span> <span class="o">**</span> <span class="n">bold</span><span class="o">**</span> <span class="ow">and</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">italic</span><span class="o">*...</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>produces “…here is how I do <strong>bold</strong> and <em>italic</em>…”.</p>
<p>These are all mechanisms designed for what these pages are designed for: <a class="reference external" href="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html">Sphinx</a>, which uses a markup language called <strong>reStructuredText</strong> as the default. Just like in other languages, programming ‘languages’ have certain rules so that you can pretty much get the same results all the time in a given environment. On the web, the most common ‘language’ is HTML:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">HTML</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
<span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">HEAD</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">header</span> <span class="n">content</span> <span class="n">here</span>
<span class="o">&lt;/</span><span class="n">HEAD</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>

<span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">BODY</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">body</span> <span class="n">of</span> <span class="n">the</span> <span class="n">text</span> <span class="n">here</span>
<span class="o">&lt;/</span><span class="n">BODY</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
<span class="o">&lt;/</span><span class="n">HTML</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>A markup language allows you to insert formatting ‘tags’ right into the text itself. For example, in HTML the markup bit would be words enclosed by lesser-than and greater-than symbols. When you create the document the interpreter sees that as instructions on how the rest of the text should look or behave. Being comfortable in that “language” is just a matter of doing it enough, just like any other language.</p>
<p>HTML is just one such “tool”. reStructuredText is another - these pages are formatted using reStructuredText. VBA is another, Python yet another… and after a while, I’ve ended up needing a reference on how do do certain things, particularly if I hadn’t done them in a while.</p>
<p>I have another GitHub help page site called <a class="reference external" href="https://robinboncoeur.github.io/HelpYrself/">Help Yourself</a> that catalogues things I sort-of learnt to do, but then, since they weren’t things I did every day, I needed to save the steps somewhere for when I needed that information again.</p>
<p>For example, the next part down - “Reminders [to Myself] of Sphinx Stuff” - is such a key thing I have these reminders in one form or another on most of my “About” pages.</p>

<h3>Changing Settings in Chrome<a class="headerlink" href="#changing-settings-in-chrome" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>These tips pertain to Chrome for Mac: doesn’t matter much which version of the Mac operating system, as far as I can tell. Open the Chrome browser:</p>
<img alt="http://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/conundrums/Cm_Chrome-4.png" src="http://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/conundrums/Cm_Chrome-4.png" />
<p>Mine is already open which is why I’ve got a white dot to the left of it. A key link on your Chrome browser is the one to your settings page. This is in the upper right-hand corner of the browser:</p>
<img alt="http://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/conundrums/Cm_Chrome-5.png" src="http://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/conundrums/Cm_Chrome-5.png" />
<p>When you click on this, you get the following menu, from which you select ‘Settings’:</p>
<img alt="http://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/conundrums/Cm_Chrome-6.png" src="http://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/conundrums/Cm_Chrome-6.png" />
<p>However, to turn off ‘dark mode’ in Chrome, you actually go to a new search page:</p>
<img alt="http://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/conundrums/Cm_Chrome-1.png" src="http://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/conundrums/Cm_Chrome-1.png" />
<p>At the bottom right-hand corner is another settings link:</p>
<img alt="http://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/conundrums/Cm_Chrome-2.png" src="http://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/conundrums/Cm_Chrome-2.png" />
<p>If you click on the ‘Dark theme: On’ menu item, it will turn Dark Theme: Off.</p>
<img alt="http://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/conundrums/Cm_Chrome-3.png" src="http://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/conundrums/Cm_Chrome-3.png" />
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

<p>In Visual Studio Code, you can use the following steps to select all the text between two instances of text:</p>
<p>Open the file you want to work with in Visual Studio Code.
Press Ctrl + F or Cmd + F to open the Find widget.
Enter the starting instance of the text you want to select in the Find input box. For example, if you want to select all the text between “start” and “end,” enter “start” in the Find input box.
Press Enter to find the first instance of the text.
Once the first instance is found, press Ctrl + F2 or Cmd + F2 to select all instances of the text in the file.
Use the Ctrl + D or Cmd + D shortcut repeatedly to move the cursor to the next instance of the text.
Keep pressing Ctrl + D or Cmd + D until you reach the second instance of the text you want to select. This will select all the text between the two instances.
If you accidentally went beyond the second instance, press Ctrl + U or Cmd + U to deselect the last selection and continue with step 7.
Once you have selected all the text you want, you can perform operations like copying, cutting, or formatting on the selected text.
By following these steps, you can easily select all the text between two instances in Visual Studio Code.</p>

<h3>How to Do Google Meet<a class="headerlink" href="#how-to-do-google-meet" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p><strong>Accepting an Invitation to a Meet</strong></p>
<p>In the email on my “Invited” email account - which is typically, usually going to be you since I’ll mostly set up these for now until you get the hang of it - you simply click on “Yes:</p>
<img alt="http://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/conundrums/Meet/Meet-16.png" src="http://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/conundrums/Meet/Meet-16.png" />
<p>or here:</p>
<img alt="http://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/conundrums/Meet/Meet-17.png" src="http://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/conundrums/Meet/Meet-17.png" />
<p>That’s in your email invitation. Doing so will add it to your Calendar, which will look like this:</p>
<img alt="http://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/conundrums/Meet/Meet-18.png" src="http://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/conundrums/Meet/Meet-18.png" />
<p>When you click on that event, it will bring up that event, and in the event you’ll simply click on the “Join with Google Meet” link, which will bring up Google Meet, activating video and you’re good to go.</p>
<hr style="height:2px;border-width:0;color:gray;background-color:gray"><p><strong>Setting up A Meet</strong></p>
<p>The following instruction are for when YOU want to set up a Meet, as opposed to joining a Meet someone else set up (i.e., accepting an invitation). To make it easier, I tend to use ‘Calendar’ that comes with GMail…. that way, I don’t have to hunt through emails to find an invitation: it’s right there in my GMail calendar. The Gmail Calendar has a little 31 in it:</p>
<img alt="http://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/conundrums/Meet/Meet-01.png" src="http://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/conundrums/Meet/Meet-01.png" />
<p>By the way (BTW), if you don’t see that Calendar icon in your right-sidebar, go down to the bottom of the page and click on:</p>
<img alt="http://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/conundrums/Meet/Meet-20.png" src="http://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/conundrums/Meet/Meet-20.png" />
<p>Then, it will appear up near the top of the right sidebar, along with other useful GMail apps. When you click on the icon, it’ll bring up that day’s events. As you can see, the get-together we had worked out a few days back is displayed in my calendar.</p>
<img alt="http://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/conundrums/Meet/Meet-02.png" src="http://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/conundrums/Meet/Meet-02.png" />
<p>Double-clicking on this event brings up all the details, including a link to the “Meet” page, generally visible in the middle of that event.</p>
<p>For example, here’s how I set up our next meeting, for next Tuesday arvo, your time; Wednesday morning, my time. I click on the date under the  word “Calendar” near the top of that dialogue (top arrow) and then, select the date from the pop-up calendar.</p>
<img alt="http://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/conundrums/Meet/Meet-04.png" src="http://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/conundrums/Meet/Meet-04.png" />
<p>I have date set up to GMT + 10hrs (which is Brisbane time) in my GMail settings. I already know that Wednesday morning at seven am is going to be Tuesday afternoon at 2pm your time. So, I add a title - not strictly necessary, but it is helpful - and set the time, and Click on “Add Google Meet video Conference”:</p>
<img alt="http://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/conundrums/Meet/Meet-07.png" src="http://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/conundrums/Meet/Meet-07.png" />
<p>I also add a description: this is a great way to share objectives and other thoughts.</p>
<img alt="http://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/conundrums/Meet/Meet-09.png" src="http://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/conundrums/Meet/Meet-09.png" />
<p>Remember, the “Join With Google Meet” brings up the “Meet” page, enabling you to join.</p>
<p>When you click on “Add Guests”: your most-contacted email recipients should appear in a list:</p>
<img alt="http://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/conundrums/Meet/Meet-10.png" src="http://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/conundrums/Meet/Meet-10.png" />
<p>Now, you should see yourself as organiser and the guest list underneath your name. It’s going to be truly awesome when we get some of the others onboard with this!</p>
<img alt="http://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/conundrums/Meet/Meet-11.png" src="http://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/conundrums/Meet/Meet-11.png" />
<p>When you click “Save” at the bottom of that event:</p>
<img alt="http://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/conundrums/Meet/Meet-12.png" src="http://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/conundrums/Meet/Meet-12.png" />
<p>you’ll be prompted to send invitations to to everyone on the guest list - saves you from having to manually send out invitations.</p>

<p>To accomplish this, you will use ‘Finder’, which is the Mac’s answer to the Window’s ‘File Explorer’. May I suggest setting up ‘Finder’ in the following fashion… makes everything a bit easier.</p>
<p>With ‘Finder’ selected, go to the menu section at the top of the Mac screen, and on the left-hand side next to the Apple logo, chose ‘Finder’ and select:</p>
<img alt="http://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/conundrums/CopyFiles/Prefs1.png" src="http://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/conundrums/CopyFiles/Prefs1.png" />
<p>Make the following changes to these settings:</p>
<img alt="http://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/conundrums/CopyFiles/Prefs2.png" src="http://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/conundrums/CopyFiles/Prefs2.png" />
<img alt="http://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/conundrums/CopyFiles/Prefs3.png" src="http://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/conundrums/CopyFiles/Prefs3.png" />
<img alt="http://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/conundrums/CopyFiles/Prefs4.png" src="http://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/conundrums/CopyFiles/Prefs4.png" />
<p>You will notice your memory stick appear in the left sidebar of ‘Finder’, under ‘Locations’ as soon as you plug it in to the USB slot. When you click on that name, the files in that folder will show up in the file browser (the main window):</p>
<img alt="http://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/conundrums/CopyFiles/Procs1.png" src="http://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/conundrums/CopyFiles/Procs1.png" />
<p>Holding down the [CMD] key - command - and pressing [A] will highlight all the files in that folder:</p>
<img alt="http://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/conundrums/CopyFiles/Procs2.png" src="http://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/conundrums/CopyFiles/Procs2.png" />
<p>Note: <em>make sure that you have actually clicked somewhere on the folder itself to select it before pressing [CMD] [A]</em>. The names of the files will change colour: mine go blue. Press [CMD] [C] to copy the files.</p>
<p>I’m going to suggest placing music files in the ‘Music’ folder, to make it easy to find the files. Identify the ‘Music folder - I’ve outlined it in red in the previous image and right-click on it and select:</p>
<img alt="http://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/conundrums/CopyFiles/Procs3.png" src="http://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/conundrums/CopyFiles/Procs3.png" />
<p>The ‘Music’ will open in a new tab and be the active folder. Press [CMD] [V] to paste your music files into that folder, or optionally right-click and select:</p>
<img alt="http://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/conundrums/CopyFiles/Procs4.png" src="http://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/conundrums/CopyFiles/Procs4.png" />
<p>Should be good to go.</p>
<p>To put your music on your iPhone, you can use the Apple Cloud or Google’s Drive. I don’t have an iPhone so I don’t know the process, but it should be fairly straight-forward.</p>

<p><strong>Update: 2022-Dec-18</strong></p>
<p>Still trying to get this right:</p>
<audio controls="controls">
  <source src="http://tightbytes.com/music/Sketches/WIPs/Sketch13df.mp3" type="audio/wav">
  Your browser does not support the <code>audio</code> element.
</audio><p><strong>Update: 2022-Aug-24</strong></p>
<p>(Note: <em>formerly “Film Projects”</em>) I can unequivocably state: right now in June 2022, I suck at video. Reason: composition. Which is why I <strong>was</strong> taking the Tomorrow’s Filmmakers course … but sort-of lost interest. Initially, I assessed it at being worth every penny. However, I really am a bit conflicted about the main presenter, who infuses his instruction with, for lack of a better term, ‘religiosity’. I mean, the message sounds like he’s promoting Christianity - I’m a Christian, and you would think I’d see him as a kindred spirit - but somehow the message seems… <em>off</em>.</p>
<p>Like, it is supposed to be about film-making techniques. If I follow a guide on composition, it would feel equally awkward and forced to keep getting the instructor’s religious viewpoints and exhortations.</p>
<p>Oh well, it was US$100. You get what you pay for.</p>
<p>Speaking of courses, since I use <a class="reference external" href="https://musescore.org/en">Musescore</a> for composing music, it totally made sense to sign up for the full “Musescore bank of courses”… there’s <a class="reference external" href="https://musescore.com/courses">heaps of really useful informatyion on these pages</a>, particularly as they were having an 85% off sale. Turns out: it totally is worth every penny! Remember, Musescore is a free download. You want to write music? this is the way to go.</p>

<h3>Music for Film<a class="headerlink" href="#music-for-film" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>I’d like to start making the sort of music that fits with film: a sound that helps make more clear what the film is trying to say. So I’ve started scoring a new piece… it’s in B minor, starts in the woodwinds with bass strings providing a sort of heartbeat (pizzicato).</p>
<p>So far, I have this:</p>

<p>It’s wintertime in Southeast Queensland. Nights are quite cool - actually feels cold to us. The noise of cars and other machines finally diminish in the evening, for which I’m rather grateful. That’s what I’m trying to say with the first few bars of this piece.</p>

Why does Trump constantly resort to name-calling and trying to bring others down below him?
The best description of Donald Trump was done by Nate White a British columnist:</p>
<p>“A few things spring to mind;</p>
<p>Trump lacks certain qualities which the British traditionally esteem.</p>
<p>For instance, he has no class, no charm, no coolness, no credibility, no compassion, no wit, no warmth, no wisdom, no subtlety, no sensitivity, no self-awareness, no humility, no honour and no grace – all qualities, funnily enough, with which his predecessor Mr. Obama was generously blessed.</p>
<p>So for us, the stark contrast does rather throw Trump’s limitations into embarrassingly sharp relief.</p>
<p>Plus, we like a laugh. And while Trump may be laughable, he has never once said anything wry, witty or even faintly amusing – not once, ever.</p>
<p>I don’t say that rhetorically, I mean it quite literally: not once, not ever. And that fact is particularly disturbing to the British sensibility – for us, to lack humour is almost inhuman.</p>
<p>But with Trump, it’s a fact. He doesn’t even seem to understand what a joke is – his idea of a joke is a crass comment, an illiterate insult, a casual act of cruelty.</p>
<p>Trump is a troll. And like all trolls, he is never funny and he never laughs; he only crows or jeers.</p>
<p>And scarily, he doesn’t just talk in crude, witless insults – he actually thinks in them. His mind is a simple bot-like algorithm of petty prejudices and knee-jerk nastiness.</p>
<p>There is never any under-layer of irony, complexity, nuance or depth. It’s all surface.</p>
<p>Some Americans might see this as refreshingly upfront.</p>
<p>Well, we don’t. We see it as having no inner world, no soul.</p>
<p>And in Britain we traditionally side with David, not Goliath. All our heroes are plucky underdogs: Robin Hood, Dick Whittington, Oliver Twist.</p>
<p>Trump is neither plucky, nor an underdog. He is the exact opposite of that.</p>
<p>He’s not even a spoiled rich-boy, or a greedy fat-cat.</p>
<p>He’s more a fat white slug. A Jabba the Hutt of privilege.</p>
<p>And worse, he is that most unforgivable of all things to the British: a bully.</p>
<p>That is, except when he is among bullies; then he suddenly transforms into a snivelling sidekick instead.</p>
<p>There are unspoken rules to this stuff – the Queensberry rules of basic decency – and he breaks them all. He punches downwards – which a gentleman should, would, could never do – and every blow he aims is below the belt. He particularly likes to kick the vulnerable or voiceless – and he kicks them when they are down.</p>
<p>So the fact that a significant minority – perhaps a third – of Americans look at what he does, listen to what he says, and then think ‘Yeah, he seems like my kind of guy’ is a matter of some confusion and no little distress to British people, given that:</p>
<p>Americans are supposed to be nicer than us, and mostly are.</p>
<p>You don’t need a particularly keen eye for detail to spot a few flaws in the man.</p>
<p>This last point is what especially confuses and dismays British people, and many other people too; his faults seem pretty bloody hard to miss.</p>
<p>After all, it’s impossible to read a single tweet, or hear him speak a sentence or two, without staring deep into the abyss. He turns being artless into an art form; he is a Picasso of pettiness; a Shakespeare of shit. His faults are fractal: even his flaws have flaws, and so on ad infinitum.</p>
<p>God knows there have always been stupid people in the world, and plenty of nasty people too. But rarely has stupidity been so nasty, or nastiness so stupid.</p>
<p>He makes Nixon look trustworthy and George W. look smart.</p>
<p>In fact, if Frankenstein decided to make a monster assembled entirely from human flaws – he would make a Trump.</p>
<p>And a remorseful Doctor Frankenstein would clutch out big clumpfuls of hair and scream in anguish:</p>
<p>‘My God… what… have… I… created?’</p>
<p>If being a twat was a TV show, Trump would be the boxed set.”</p>
<p>Thank you Nate White.</p>

<h3>VSCode Search Tip<a class="headerlink" href="#vscode-search-tip" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>In Visual Studio Code, you can use regular expressions (regex) to select all text between specific markers like “startstart” and “endend”. Here’s how you can do it:</p>
<p>Open the file in Visual Studio Code.
Press Ctrl + F (or Cmd + F on macOS) to open the search box.
Click on the icon with the three dots (⋯) to expand the search options.
Enable the regex mode by clicking on the .* icon or by pressing Alt + R.
In the search box, enter the following regex pattern: startstart([sS]*?)endend.
startstart and endend are the markers you want to use to select the text in between.
[sS]*? matches any character (including line breaks) between the start and end markers, non-greedily.
Press Enter to start the search.
Visual Studio Code will highlight the matched text. To select all the occurrences, click on the “Select All” button or press Ctrl + Shift + L (or Cmd + Shift + L on macOS).
You can now modify, delete, or copy the selected text as needed.
Note: Make sure your document doesn’t contain nested instances of the start and end markers. If you have nested markers, the regex pattern may not work as intended.</p>
<p>Remember to exercise caution when modifying or deleting text using regex, as it can have unintended consequences. Always make sure to have a backup of your file before performing such operations.</p>

<h3>OpenAI Key Suggestions for B Minor<a class="headerlink" href="#openai-key-suggestions-for-b-minor" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>In addition to D major, there are several other keys that complement the B minor key. Here are some common choices:</p>
<p>G major: G major is the relative major of B minor. These keys share the same key signature and have a close relationship, making them complementary to each other.</p>
<p>A major: A major is another complementary key to B minor. It shares two common tones with B minor (A and D) and provides a brighter and uplifting tonal contrast.</p>
<p>E minor: E minor is the parallel minor of G major and is harmonically related to B minor. It shares two common tones with B minor (E and B) and can create a melancholic or introspective musical atmosphere when used in conjunction with B minor.</p>
<p>F# major: F# major is the major key that is a semitone above B minor. It provides a sharp tonal contrast and can be used to create tension or a sense of brightness when juxtaposed with B minor.</p>
<p>These are just a few examples of keys that complement the B minor key. Ultimately, the choice of complementary keys will depend on the musical context and the desired emotional effect.</p>
<p>Scientists don’t <em>think</em> (assume) anything, they make no assumptions. Science is evidence-driven. There is a fallacy in this assertion.</p>
