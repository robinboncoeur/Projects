## Exploring Workflows

**02
Generally speaking, I've had less than stellar experiences trying other people's workflows. If they're simple enough for me to get my 70-odd (emphasis on the '*odd*') year head around it, I can generally get things to work. But sometimes things are a bit too bespoke and I get lost in the weeds. Go to install nodes or models or stuff the workflow asks for and come to find out that I'm on the wrong version of Python.  
And basically stuff up my ComfyUI install and have to start from scratch.

ComfyUI *is* becoming more robust, so stuffing up one's install has become less of a problem.

Whilst the fact that 'my' [little workflow on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/comfyui/comments/1okk9xg/persistent_consistent_characters_in_flux_srpo/) has enjoyed, to date, 3200+ views and 8 likes, no one is asking for help with it. The only comments on the page are mine. Which tells me: no-one is interested in static images anymore, they want video.  
Fine, whatever. Done my bit, shared with the community.

A lot of what I'm learning is on the ComfyUI subReddit. So, I found a new workflow for SRPO today, something I wasn't looking for, but -- **WOW!** -- am I glad I found this one.

It wasn't all that straight-forward going, gettting this workflow working. Had to install a few nodes -- *as you do* -- and then, tried to work out why 'Flash-Attention2' wasn't working. And found out the I'd need a more recent flavour of CUDA (the NVidia driver) and-and-and... nah -- not going there. Had another look at the options for that section of the workflow, and found something alternative to Flash-Attention2 that I already have.

Now, this workflow was developed **AGES** ago (which means a few weeks or months, not *years*) so a node has disappeared -- the ImageSmartSharpen node, used to be part of the ComfyUI Essentials nodeset -- so you can't even install it.

Here's where Reddit comes into its own. A user (*Nevereast*) posted this:

"*For anyone who also googles this: you can fix this yourself: you can browse the repo and view the history of images.py and find the missing component (ImageSmartSharpen) was removed in the latest release. I just copied the code block from the version prior to the release and put it in the corresponding file in my local environment. There should be three changes: one for the component, and two pointer variables overriding the core image smart sharpen. Hope this helps anyone else who has this issue.*"

'Nevereast' meant 'image.py', but anyway, followed the instructions, works a treat!!

*Explainer for Nevereast's post:*  
- 'browse the repo' = have a look in the original [GitHub repository](https://github.com/cubiq/ComfyUI_essentials)  
- 'view the history of images.py' = there's an **image.py**, download that file  
- 'copied the code block' = I didn't: I just went into the /ComfyUI/custome_nodes/comfyui_essentials folder, renamed 'image.py' to 'image.bak' and placed the file I download in its place as 'image.py'. Works after you reboot the ComfyUI server.

So, why all the bother? Was this all worth it?

I invite you to click on one of the above two images, save it, open it in your favourite image-editing software (or viewing, *peu importe*) and **zoom in**.

The quality is **next level**.
