## Pappa's Account

[Back to the Main Page](../index.md)

### Foreword

This is, for the time being, a living document. As such, it will change pretty much *daily* as the process continues.

The idea of having these pages worked on in the image order simply makes sense... for now. Once all images have been converted to text and the text translated, then the next step - organising the document in some sort of chronological order - will be much easier.

For my part, I will work on transcribing the words on the images - handwritten and typed - into this document as accurately as I can. The chapter headings will be the names of the original image files - e.g., 'P8.png'. I've attached a .jpg version at the bottom of each section: simply right-click and select "Open Image in a New Tab" to see the full-sized version.

I would suggest keeping Dad's account as written in **German** as part of the book for future reference.

### Project Notes

**[ 4 Jul 2025 ]**  
At this stage, the image order doesn't appear to correlate to any sort of order, certainly not what I would assume the original order of Pappa's document would have been. I will therefore take the following approach to translating this document: 

1. transcription / translation, saved to this page (a rough draught, as it were)
2. re-order / organise / edit for context - this will be a collaborative effort

Outlined here are the steps I'm taking:

* adjust image brightness / contrast of the imagescontaining the text in GIMP to try to improve legibility
* type in the words into PhoenixCode, a plain-text document processor
* read the sentence out loud, and adjust based on what it sounds like (e.g., changed 'lieben' to 'lieber')
* "build" the document using [ **cd /Users/me/Sites/projects && mkdocs serve** ]
* copy the 'family' folder to www.tightbytes.com

Additional steps will include:

* bring up the site on my desktop
* copy the German text into the Gradio interface for text-generation-webui, running the Gemmas3 large language model
* Gemma3: do a German-language spelling and grammar check
* Gemma3: translate from German into English
* review the result, adjust for context

We will have to subsequently realign the document pages into some sort of logical order. This will require a collaborative effort.

### Issues
**[ 5 Jul 2025 ]**  
Some images are over-exposed through the scanning process. The bright light of the scanner makes both sides of the page visible in the resulting .png image: this affects legibility. Also, the typed documents (P1.png through P3.png) were not centred properly when they were scanned and so portions of words are missing.

* Trying to get the text entered - doing grammar/spelling-check and translation after the bulk of what **can** be done, done.  
* Case in point: **P12.png** cannot be read at all. It will need to be photographed, not scanned. Both sides show up on one surface (both sides are visible in the image). Together with Dad's unclear handwriting, the document is too difficult to decipher.  
* The first images (P1, P2, P3 and P3plus) are all typed. However, the scan was not well-centred and cut off words on the right margin. Below, I have noted which words appear to be cut off with "-[cut-off word]".  
* Issues with P14 and P14plus, cut-off words and scanned text hard to make out. Needs to be photographed, and centred properly.

**[ 7 Jul 2025 ]**   
Tried a translation of **P1.png** using the Gemma3 LLM. I've surrounded the document with my observations of the process. I'm going to leave those notes as an example of what's involved in translating - well, a rather small example, to be honest. We really need to collaborate on context and intent. I've underlined words that raised questions:

* 'operation' vs 'activities'
* 'upright' vs 'as straight as possible'
* the phrase 'didn't have the right weight yet' vs 'didn't weigh enough'

The sentence: 'Ein Urbaier in Lederhosen, seine Frau – in wir Jungens sofort alle verliebten – kam jeden Sonntag mit.' should probably read: 'He was a typical Bavarian in lederhosen: his wife – who we boys immediately fell in love with – accompanied him every Sunday."

At least Gemma tries to explain her reasoning, which is a step up from the hallucinations of LLMs such as older versions of ChatGPT or even DeepSeek-v1, which also 'explained' its thought-process, however erroneous it turned out to be.


**[ 8 Jul 2025 ]**   
I've decided the image downloads would be quicker - and the page would *'weigh'* less if I converted the .pngs to .jpgs. I'll put the originals in a 'Origs' subfolder in case someone wants to see the original scanned image.  

- Page 17 (P17.png) seems to be a fragment.

- Pages 22 and 22plus need to be photographed (vs scanned): enhancing the text brings out the text from the other side of the page, making it impossible to read.

- Pages 35 through 46 appear at first blush to be private correspondence between Dad and Mom... not sure how appropriate it would be to enter this private stuff. Even the stuff on P31 is a bit... iffy.  
I'm going to start with running some of these entries through Gemma3 after reviewing them again. I've taken to surrounding words I'm not sure about with square brackets: '[ ]'. I've also replaced most of the .pngs with .jpgs for faster load times.

**[ 1 Oct 2025 ]**

In receipt of the physical documents. I have begun restructuring the translation page to reflect chronology vs image sequence. Some of the chronology of events we will have to determine contextually: we probably won't know exact dates for certain entries.
