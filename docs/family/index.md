## Pappa's Account

### Foreword

This is, for the time being, a living document. As such, it will change pretty much *daily* as the process continues.

The idea of having these pages worked on in the image order simply makes sense... for now. Once all images have been converted to text and the text translated, then the next step - organising the document in some sort of chronological order - will be much easier.

For my part, I will work on transcribing the words on the images - handwritten and typed - into this document as accurately as I can. The chapter headings will be the names of the original image files - e.g., 'P8.png'. I've attached a .jpg version at the bottom of each section: simply right-click and select "Open Image in a New Tab" to see the full-sized version.

I would suggest keeping Dad's account as written in **German** as part of the book for future reference.
