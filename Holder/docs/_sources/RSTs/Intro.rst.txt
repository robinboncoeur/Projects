Why these Projects Pages? 
*************************

I guess what set it off was trying to upload images to a GMail email I was sending to Martin and Esther on 2022-Apr-15. Got about halfway through and GMail told me I'd exceeded the size limit (25mb). Which seems silly. And there's no video, even... just pictures.

What appeals to me about doing project progress sharing this way is:

	I can share a LOT of information no-cost
	
	The information is hidden in obscurity of "no-one gives a rat's nether-regions about what I'm doing"... just have a look at `Tightbytes <https://www.tightbytes.com/>`_. Visitors? none.
	
I'm doing this with dates as the header. As in: here's where I am so far with this project.
