Consider the following discourse. For example: the last sentence of the original document included the word 'Urbaier', which breaks down to 'Ur' = 'typical'; and 'Baier' = 'person from Bayern (Bavaria)'. Gemma incorrectly translated this to 'Urlauber' = 'tourist'. A key takeaway is that one cannot simply assume LLMs are going to correctly interpret the sense of a phrase. My discussion with Gemma3 continued thus as I requested 'her' to translate into English:</p> <p>Me: 'Urbaier' is a colloquial term for 'typical Baier'... person from Bavaria. Other than that, well done, thank you. Can you please translation this into English?</p> <p>Gemma3: You're absolutely right about \"Urbaier\"! My apologies for the misinterpretation \u2013 it's a regional colloquialism that doesn't translate directly. Thanks for clarifying. Here's the English translation of the corrected German text, incorporating that understanding of \"Urbaier\":</p> <p>\"For Kurtchen's 15th birthday, he only had one wish from his father: to sign the waiver. It was a document stating that in the event of an accident, the state would not be liable for the damages. His father looked at him incredulously.       \"What, do you want to learn to fly? First, learn to run properly!\"         A signature was cheap as a gift. His father thought it was just a fleeting idea of his son\u2019s. Finally, Kurtchen was allowed to participate in the flying operations. But that was pretty much all there was to it.       Every Sunday, a group of young people met in Wei\u00dfenfels at the so-called Idiot's Hill.         The glider that the boys toiled with all day was a Grunau 9. The thing actually flew. Kurtchen tried hard to stand upright, but he was always overlooked. He was just too small and didn't have the right weight yet.       In the following spring, they got a new flying instructor. During the lunch break, he asked who among you is 'Hahn Kurt'? This Mr. M\u00fcnch was a work colleague of my father\u2019s at the Leuna Works. A typical Bavarian tourist, his wife \u2013 who we boys immediately fell in love with \u2013 came every Sunday.\"</p> <p></p> <p>Gemma3: Notes on the Translation: I've translated \"Urbaier\" as \"typical Bavarian tourist\" to convey the intended meaning. I\u2019ve tried to maintain the slightly informal and conversational tone of the original German.</p> <p>Me: Fail. Nice try, though, Gemma.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"family/pappa1/#1941-sommer-23","title":"[1941] Sommer 2,3","text":"<p>[Auf Deutsch]</p> <p>Sommer 1941</p> <p>Die Luftwaffe hatte uns erlaubt an den Wochenenden auf den Merseburger Flugplatz f\u00fcr die B und C zu schulen, a Die A pr\u00fcfung hatte ich ja hinter mir, Doch nahm mich niemand so richtig f\u00fcr voll, Die Kleinen wurden nur zu leicht uebersehen.</p> <p>Monatelang war ich regelm\u00e4\u00dfig zum Flug dienst erschienen, aber niemand schenkte mir beachtung.

Then his parents started in: they had strictly forbidden him to fight. His father beat him mercilessly. Every day became a day of misery. The only escape was to run away. There were the Hollers.

With tear-streaked and swollen eyes, he rang the corridor doorbell. Limp and exhausted, he was greeted with a slap from his mother.

The leather strop he used to sharpen his razor came lashing down on little Karl. By no stretch could this day have been considered lucky. Never before had he felt so utterly crushed as when he crawled into bed that evening. There was no supper. Nor was he allowed to go up to his grandmother on the third floor for a cup of peppermint tea.</p> <p>\"Tomorrow I\u2019m going to the Hollers,\" he thought.</p> <p>He left for school an hour early. When he asked his teacher for a moment to speak, he was gruffly dismissed. As Karl walked away, crying, the bastard cursed at him from behind. With his school satchel on his back, he headed straight to Auntie Holler. Auntie first gave him a little piece of chocolate, then sat and listened carefully to the whole story.</p> <p>\"I\u2019m taking you to school. This is outrageous.\"</p> <p>\"Please, Auntie, don\u2019t.\"</p> <p>\"Karlchen, I promise you \u2014 no one is going to lay a finger on you today. And I\u2019m going to have a word with your father, too.\"</p> <p>He had never seen Auntie like that before. When they arrived at the school, she went straight to the headmaster\u2014not to the teacher.

Even though it\u2019s assumed that anyone starting the study of composition already has a solid understanding of music theory, it\u2019s still a good idea to begin with a quick review of intervals. If your understanding of intervals is a little shaky, it can make learning harmony more difficult than it needs to be.</p> <p>\u266b An interval is simply the relationship between two notes, based on where they sit in the scale. The lower of the two notes is called the root (or historically, \"fundamental\") tone. The names we give to intervals come from Latin ordinal numbers\u2014like second, third, fourth\u2014which count the number of steps from the lower note to the higher one.</p> <p></p> <p>Fig. 1</p> <p>\u266b Changing how high or low an interval sounds doesn't change what we call it. It just makes the distance between the notes bigger or smaller. To understand this better, we're going to organize these intervals into two different groups.</p> <ol> <li>Large (major), small (minor), augmented and diminished intervals; (to which belong Seconds, Thirds, Sixths and Sevenths)</li> <li>perfect, augmented and diminished intervals; (to which belong: Primes, Octaves, Fifths and Fourths) </li> </ol> <p>\u266b A minor interval is a half-step smaller than a major interval. An augmented interval is a half-step larger than a major or perfect interval. A diminished interval is a half-step smaller than a minor or perfect interval. If an interval starts on the first note of a major scale, it will be either a major or a perfect interval. Now, let's find out how many whole and half steps are in each of these intervals. This will give us a way to compare all intervals to each other:</p> <p></p> <p>Fig. 2</p> <p>\u266b Now that we understand different types of musical intervals and how to measure them, we can create any relationship we want between two notes. To show you how, we'll make a table showing all the intervals that start with the note C:</p> <ul> <li>A major Second  contains 1      whole tone</li> <li>A major Third   contains 2      whole tones</li> <li>A pure  Fourth  contains 2 1/2  whole tones</li> <li>A pure  Fifth   contains 3 1/2  whole tones</li> <li>A major Sixth   contains 4 1/2  whole tones</li> <li>A major Seventh contains 5 1/2  whole tones</li> <li>A pure  Octave  contains 6      whole tones</li> <li>A pure  Prime   contains 0      whole tones</li> </ul> <p>\u266b This shows us that a major or perfect interval can become a minor, diminished, or augmented interval by either raising or lowering the higher note. Alternatively, we can change the interval by raising or lowering the lower note, while keeping the higher note the same. For example: </p> <p></p> <p>Fig. 3</p> <p>\u266b Intervals larger than an octave are just repeats of the relationships found within an octave. The 'ninth' is the only interval that has a unique and important role in harmony. </p> <p></p> <p>Fig. 4</p> <p>\u266b An interval's inversion is created by moving the higher note down an octave or moving the lower note up an octave. The resulting relationships is shown in the following graph.</p> <p>+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------+ |                                                                               | +=========+=========+=========+=========+=========+=========+=========+=========+ |    1    |    2    |    3    |    4    |    5    |    6    |    7    |    8    | +---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+ |    8    |    7    |    6    |    5    |    4    |    3    |    2    |    1    | +---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+</p> <p>The inverted Prime becomes an Octave, the Second a Seventh, the Third a Sixth, the Fourth a Fifth, the Fifth a Fourtb, the Sixth a Third, the Seventh a Second, the Octave a Prime. </p> <p></p> <p>Fig. 5</p> <p>Major intervals become minor, while minor intervals become major; augmented intervals become diminished, diminished intervals augmented; pure intervals however remain pure. </p> <p></p> <p>Fig. 6</p> <p>\u266b Depending on how they sound, intervals are categorized as Consonances and Dissonances. Consonances sound complete and create a sense of rest. Dissonances, on the other hand, create a feeling of movement and need to be resolved by the next interval.</p> <p>\u266b Major and minor intervals of the octave, perfect fifth, major third, minor third, major sixth, and minor sixth are considered consonances. The octave, perfect fifth, major third, and minor third are called perfect consonances, while major and minor sixths are imperfect consonances. Seconds, sevenths, and all intervals that are augmented or diminished are dissonances. A perfect fourth has qualities of both consonance and dissonance, but leans more towards dissonance.</p>"},{"location":"music/Harmony/#harmony","title":"Harmony","text":"<p>\u266b \u00a7 1.

Together, these chords use all the notes of the major scale, and because they are so closely related, they clearly establish the key. They\u2019re also enough to harmonize any melody that stays within that key. These triads are strongly connected because of how closely related their home keys are. Specifically, the chords on the 4th (Subdominant) and 5th (Dominant) degrees of a key are also the tonic (I) chords in their own respective keys. And these keys happen to be the closest neighbors to the original key in the Circle of Fifths. Therefore, the close relationship between these three major triads (I, IV, V) in any key reflects the close relationship between their keys in the Circle of Fifths. Their similarity is even clearer when you realise they share many of the same notes \u2014 especially in their tetrachords (four-note scale fragments).</p> <p>\u00a7 6.

In music chords are either used in masses, that is with manifold repetitions of one and the same interval -- as is the case in compositions for orchestra and Pianoforte -- or they are set for several, single, distinct voices. \"Four-voiced-writing\" is the commonest and most normal form, as it denotes the four different human voices, namely: Soprano, Alto, Tenor and Bass. So, in our study of Harmony we shall keep to this disposition of the voices. The highest voice, Soprano -- and the deepest voice -- Bass, are called the two outer voices. The two intermediate voices: Alto and Tenor: the two inner voices.</p> <p>\u00a7 9. Turning now to the practical application of the above treated chords, we will begin with placing the fundamental tone in the Bass. In the higbest voice any of the three tones of the chord, the fundamental tone, the Tbird or the Fifth may be used. For the two inner voices we will use respectively the intervals of the triad nearest to the Soprano. The C major triad would thus appear as follows: </p> <p>img 12</p> <p>These three cases are called the positions of the chord. According to the interval of the triad which appears in the Soprano, these positions are called the fundamental position or position of the octave, the position of the Third, and the position of the Fifth.</p> <p>\u00a7 10. From the above example we see that in each of the three positions the fundamental tone is used twice, while the third and fifth appear but once. Shall this always be the case? By no means! In a free leading of the voices the composer may double any tone of the chord at will. For the present, however, we cannot avail ourselves of this liberty, since according to \u00a7 9, we must place the inner voices as close as possible to the upper voice. Indeed, the doubling of the fundamental tone will always be the most common, as it is most natural to the triad [1].</p> <p>\u00a7 11. We have already mentioned (\u00a7 6) the internal relationship of the triads of the scale. Now, there is still another and purely external connection of these triads, growing out of the tones they have in common.</p> <p>The triads c, e, g and g, b, d for instance have the tone g in common, while the triad f, a, c shares the tone c with the triad c, e, g. In fact, each triad has one or two tones in common with every other triad constructed on steps of the same scale, except in the case where the fundamentals are directly succeeding steps. So, the triad on C has no tone in common with the triads on b and d; the triad on d, none with the triads on c and e, and so on. The mutual relationship of the triads with regard to their external connection is shown in the following table: </p> <p>img 13</p> <p>To effect a connection of two triads at once correct and satisfying to the ear, it is necessary to retain the common tone of the triads in the same voice. Conscientious application of this rule imparts fluency, euphony and unity to the harmony; moreover it enables the pupil to avoid many grave errors, which, otherwise, he would of necessity commit. Take for instance the triad on c in the octave position, and let us connect it successively with other triads containing tones in common with it. Which positions of the new chords must we then choose? Obviously those which enable us to retain the oom- mon tone, or tones in the same voice. Consequently the G major triad must appear in position of the third, F major in the position of the fifth, A minor in position of the third and E minor again in position of the fifth.</p> <p>img 14</p> <p>The progression and position, therefore, of the three upper voices is influenced by the common tones. Meanwhile the Bass may progress upward or downward at liberty. Should we have to choose between a skip of a sixth and one of a third, we prefer the latter [2].</p> <p>Footnotes:</p> <p>[1] The major triads are indicated by capital letter; minor triads by small letters</p> <p>[2] Having a purely practical aim in this work, we shall avoid minute explanations and justifications of the different rules. It were well for the pupil to search out instinctively, as it were, the justification of the several rules. For this purpose he should thoroughly test them by ear on the piano. A true musical instinct will at once convince him, that all these rules originated in the demands of his own ear. </p> <p>img 15</p> <p>I Remark. In addition to these examples, which consist in supplying the remaining three voices to a given bass, it is very beneficia! to construct a table, which shall contain all the possible connections of all triads with one another, in every position. To this end the example (M 13) begun in this paragraph on C should be carried on further. The pupil must not be disheartened, when he finds that at the very beginning of his study, 20 chords must be written out in one key alone. In the first place the labor is merely a mechanical one, and in the second place it is important that by thoroughgoing explanations of the rudiments we should dispel at the start the superstitious awe that prevails regarding the so-called \"Theory\" or \"Thorough Bass\"</p> <p>II. Remark: In harmonizing a bass, care should be taken not to lead the voices too high; therefore one must not choose too high a position of the tonic triad at the start. </p>"},{"location":"music/Harmony/#chapter-iii","title":"Chapter III","text":""},{"location":"music/Harmony/#connection-of-triads-no-external-agreement","title":"Connection of Triads, no external agreement","text":"<p>\u00a7 12. Jn the preceding chapter we spoke of the beauty of harmonies connected by common tones. This absolute completeness in chord-connection, however, does not exclude the admissibility of certain connections, which, while perhaps less pleasing, satisfy us by very reason of their sharpness or coarseness. This we can understand if we consider the aim of Music, which is, to picture the many various emotions of the soul: and these cannot always be expressed by dulcet soothing means. For this reason Harmony admits also such chord-connections, which show no outer relationship - though they may bear an inner relationship to one another. (\u00a7 5 ).</p> <p>\u00a7 13. Should we not, when connecting two chords not outwardly related chose again those positions, that permit a melodious, fluent leading of the voices? Should we not, to avoid jumps, lead eMh voice info the nearest interval, a second up or down? For instance as follows: </p> <p>img 16</p> <p>Before answering these questions, however, let us see, what different kinds of voice-motions there are.</p> <p>We perceive the three following kinds:     1) Parallel motion (motus rectus), in which two voices progress in one and the same direction, that is, upwards or downwards </p> <p>img 17</p> <pre><code>2) Oblique motion (motus obliquus), in which one voice remains stationary, while the other moves onward:\n</code></pre> <p>img 18</p> <pre><code>3) Contrmy motion (motus contrarius); one voice progresses upwards, the other downwards.\n</code></pre> <p>img 19</p> <p>All these various motions are admissible in every succession of harmonies. Observe, however, the so-called Parallelisms occurring in the motus rectus; these are progressions, in which the two voices move not only in the same direction, but also in the same interval; for instance: when two voices progress upward or downward in Seconds or Fourths.</p> <p>img 20</p> <p>Some of these Parallelisms are indeed very euphonious and, therefore, like the other motions, entirely permissible. Others, however, are to be avoided partly because they do not satisfy the musical ear and again, because they counteract the independent movement of the voices. Such forbidden progressions are Parallel Fifths and Octaves.</p> <p>img 21</p> <p>Remark. To comprehend clearly the reason for prohibiting parallel Fifths and Octaves, it must be borne in mind that we have to deal not with the massive harmonization of orchestra or piano composition, but with 4 separate independent voices, which do not permit of extensive doubling. Should the question arise whether only parallel octaves and fifths are forbidden, and parallel dissonant intervals permitted, we may add, that for the present we are familiar only with tone-combinations, in which such progressions do not occur. Once for all, then, let it be said that in Harmony progressions of parallel fifths and octaves are prohibited.</p> <p>Now only are we in a position to answer the question put at the beginning of this paragraph. lf we wish to connect two triads having no external relationship, we can not lead all the voices a second upwards or downwards, as parallel fifths and octaves would arise. </p> <p>img 22</p> <p>To avoid this fault we must employ contrary motion, without, however, proceeding in great skips. The fault is by no means corrected, if we replace the step of a second by a skip of a seventh in the opposite direction (contrary motion), as in that case the fifths and octaves really remain. </p> <p>img 23</p> <p>Moreover, we obtain a very unmelodious skip of a seventh in the Bass.</p> <p>So we will allow the Bass to retain its melodious step of a second, and, employing contrary motion, lead each of the other voices into the nearest interval of the following chord:</p> <p>img 24</p> <p>We have now learned, how to connect, within its own limits, all the consonant chords of the major scale in all positions.

Otherwise, there's still a lot of issues.</p> <p>There's stuff that, as Mozart would have winced at as he tried Salieri's piece on the clavichord - \"..this doesn't really work, does it?\" Starting in measure 10, that first bang of the timpani: excess to requirement.</p> <p>But it gets worse.</p> <p>A real quandary lies in measures 15 through 19... this is the 4th attempt at a reasonable - but questionable - segway into what follows. So, re-thinking this. It's just doesn't flow right. It actually sounds better in MS3 than Reaper. Reaper is the acid test as to whether this works, though.</p> <p>I actually feel bad for the timpani player: wanted to give him a bit more to do, but those are the only spots that seem indicated.</p> <p>And I feel bad for the brass section.</p> <p>In this sort of piece - using Alice Mary Smith's First Movement of her C-minor symphony as an example, she explores a few melodic ideas with her horns - I have transcribed her first movement into Musescore and hope to post it soon - but it seems a lot of what she does is have them sort-of provide harmonic overtones, which I tried to do in measures 26 through 31 (and the repeat). And I'm not keen on the result: the poor french horn player has to play fairly softly - never an easy thing for the french horn in the higher registers - and so it doesn't sound at all realistic. But what I find more unacceptable is what he actually plays... it's just: meh. So, do I take it out or try something a bit cleverer... same with the tuba. I'm asking these players to fill a supporting role, but they tend to stand out a bit more than I'd like.</p> <p>By the way, I can't seem to get MS to include the full score in Landscape mode into a PDF.

I've hit 70, finally retired from 40-odd years of nursing with a bad back to show for it.

However, I did let my twenty-five year-old brain dictate utter nonsense to my 70-y-o body and my back finally gave out.

Learn what proofing is, why you should proof in the fridge, and how long to proof sourdough in the fridge.</p> <p>You\u2019ve probably heard that proofing your sourdough in the fridge is one of the best ways to make a loaf with an incredible flavor and texture. But what does that mean, exactly? And how do you go about doing it?</p> <p>What is proofing?</p> <p>In both regular (yeasted) bread making and sourdough baking, proofing refers to the rise after shaping. During yeasted baking it's often called the final rise.</p> <p>During the proofing process, the shaped dough is allowed to rest and rise, usually until it doubles in size. This allows the yeast to do its job and create carbon dioxide gas, stretching the gluten in the dough, and trapping the gas in bubbles within the bread.</p> <p>This step is critically important for all bread or leavened goods, to give them a light, airy texture, not to mention the flavor! Without proofing, our bread would be flat, dense, and taste bland.</p> <p>Why proof sourdough in the fridge</p> <p>In most of my SOURDOUGH RECIPES, I give the option to proof at room temperature for 1-3 hours or place in the fridge for a cold ferment. Whenever I have the option of choosing room temperature or proofing in the fridge, I always choose the fridge!</p> <p>Proofing sourdough at cold temperatures is often called a cold retard, because it slows down the final rise process.</p> <p>So why proof sourdough in the fridge?</p> <ol> <li> <p>better flavor:</p> <p>Dough that has been proofed in the fridge has a more complex, sourer flavor than room temperature proofed dough. When the bread is proofing at room temperature, the dough develops faster than the flavor, by slowing it down and proofing in the fridge, we are allowing the flavor to develop in time with the dough.</p> </li> </ol> <p>This is a direct result of the temperature slowing down the yeast's fermentation activity, but the bacteria in the starter are less dependent on the temperature and they are able to continue breaking down starches into LACTIC AND ACETIC ACIDS, giving us that sour tang we can't get enough of!</p> <ol> <li> <p>easier to handle:</p> <p>Cold dough is much much easier to handle. It's easier to flip out of your BANNETON, it's easier to score, it's just easier to work with.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Warm dough tends to flatten once turned out of its banneton, giving you less time to flip it, score it, and transfer it to a dutch oven. The lame also tends to stick to the warm dough.</p> <p>Cold dough is less urgent, it resists spreading for longer, it's by far easier to score, and because it's more sturdy, it's easier to get into your dutch oven!</p> <ol> <li> <p>adds flexibility:</p> <p>Sourdough is a process, a process I've come to truly enjoy, but it still takes a while.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Allowing your sourdough to cold retard in the fridge puts you back in the driver's seat when it comes to baking sourdough. Proofing in the fridge extends your proofing window from 1-3 hours to days! You can bake that bread on your schedule, not the dough's!</p> <ol> <li> <p>better crust + crumb:</p> <p>This one might be splitting hairs a little bit, but a cold fermented dough usually has a superior crust and crumb to a sourdough proofed at room temperature.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Baking cold sourdough tends to give that delicious, blistered crust that's somehow crispy but also delicate at the same time. It's 12/10 perfect.</p> <p>The crumb is better because it takes time for gluten development in the dough especially with recipes that don't incorporate kneading to speed it up. But this process is not temperature dependant. Allowing the sourdough to proof in the fridge slows the yeast down, allowing gluten development to catch up to the gasses released making for better-leavened bread and crumb.</p> <p>How to proof sourdough in the fridge</p> <p>This is the easy part! Follow the recipe as written until you get to the final shaping stage: </p> <pre><code>* Shape the dough as desired, in a boule or batard. Place the shaped loaf into a BANNETON or banneton alternative.\n* Cover the banneton with a plastic shower cap, or slide into a plastic bag.\n* Place the covered banneton into the fridge for your desired length of time.\n* When ready to bake, simply preheat oven and dutch oven. Once the oven is preheated, you can bake the sourdough straight from the fridge.\n</code></pre> <p>How long to proof sourdough in the fridge</p> <p>While there is a wide range of times that your sourdough can be proofed in the fridge and there is no right or wrong answer, keep your cold retard time frame within reason. While a short 2-hour cold ferment will do nothing for the flavor, it can help if you have to pick up the kids from school while you should be baking!</p> <p>A super-long 84-hour cold retard is probably too long and will result in over-proofed bread that lacks energy for decent oven spring.</p> <p>I find the sweet spot for me and my starter is 24-48 hours.</p> <p>This might take some trial and error to nail it down to your liking, but I'd start with 18-24 hours!</p> <p>My preferences for proofing in the fridge</p> <p>For this post, I made 2 identical batches of sourdough using my SMALL LOAF SOURDOUGH RECIPE at the same time, everything was done exactly the same, except the proofing time.</p> <p>My findings may surprise you, but my favourite fridge proofing time, for my starter, is 48 hours. The loaf with the large air pockets was proofed for 24 hours in the fridge and the loaf with the smaller pockets was proofed 48 hours - its crumb was a lot more open than the photos show, it was likely just cut in the worst spot!</p> <p>In the photo below, the crumb is actually slightly underdeveloped in the loaf with the large air pockets. This was apparent in the texture as well. The longer fermented bread was lighter and airier, in addition to having a more pleasing mildly sour taste, while the 24-hour cold fermented loaf lacked depth and complexity in the flavor.</p> <p>The 48-hour bread also had a better oven spring and bloomed more at the score, this is apparent in the overhead photos below.</p> <p>[faq]</p> <p>I don't have a banneton, can I still proof my sourdough in the fridge?</p> <p>Heck yes! Sourdough is a super adaptable recipe, and I made it for over a year without a banneton. Here's a list of BANNETON ALTERNATIVES.</p> <p>Do I need to proof my sourdough in the fridge? Or can I do it at room temperature?</p> <p>You're totally able to proof at room temperature, it just occurs quickly, between 1 and 3 hours, usually, so be prepared to bake shortly after the final shaping.</p> <p>What is cold retard or cold ferment? Are they the same?</p> <p>A cold retard is simply the act of proofing your sourdough bread at cold temperatures (around 34f). Because the low temperature slows the yeast activity in the dough, it is called retarding. Cold fermenting and cold retarding are two different names for the same process.</p> <p>The slowed fermentation rate is why I recommend STORING YOUR SOURDOUGH STARTER in the fridge if you're an infrequent baker!</p> <p>Should I cover my dough during a cold ferment?</p> <p>Absolutely! Please cover your dough. Use a dedicated shower cap or even a recycled bread bag! The fridge can be a very drying place, due to the forced air inside to keep the temperature constant, this will dry out your bread and affect its oven spring and potentially ruin that irresistible crust!</p> <p>When should I be putting my dough into the fridge for the cold retard? As soon as you've finished shaping the dough and placing it into its banneton or rising bowl, cover it up, and chuck it in the fridge! The longer the dough is left at room temperature, the longer the yeast has to consume the flour and the more likely that the dough will over-proof.</p> <p>So pop it into the fridge as soon as the final shape is done!</p> <p>Will my sourdough double in size if it's cold fermented?</p> <p>It will not! But don't be fooled, that doesn't mean that it won't puff up during baking. The cold temperature of the fridge slows down the yeast so the bacteria in the bread have time to work and create sour flavors while the gluten develops. Your bread will still rise beautifully and have a great oven spring because the yeast hasn't consumed all the available food, they'll reactivate during the baking process.</p> <p>Remember::</p> <p>Alle Dinge sind Gift, und nichts ist ohne Gift; allein die Dosis macht, dass ein Ding kein Gift ist.

Additionally, the person that Julia had engaged to redo the footpaths thought putting down cardboard - as in: container boxes - under the gravel as a weed deterrent was a good idea (it wasn't: cardboard breaks down quickly, and weeds aren't picky what they grow in) and chose that horrid pumic-gravel to cover the existing river-rock.

Lustig argues that the rise of consumerism, the food industry, and technology have created a culture that promotes the constant pursuit of pleasure, often through the overconsumption of food, drugs, and technology, and that this pursuit of pleasure has led to a decline in our physical and mental health.</p> <p>Lustig examines the role of two types of pleasure in our lives: \"liking\" and \"wanting.\" \"Liking\" is the feeling of enjoyment we get from pleasurable experiences, such as eating good food or spending time with loved ones. \"Wanting\" is the desire for more of these pleasurable experiences, even when they are harmful, such as addiction to drugs or overeating.</p> <p>Lustig argues that the food industry has capitalized on the \"wanting\" aspect of pleasure by creating addictive, processed foods that stimulate our brain's reward center and encourage overeating. He also discusses the impact of technology on our brains, including social media and video games, which can provide a constant source of \"wanting\" pleasure that can be just as addictive as drugs or food.</p> <p>Lustig suggests that we can improve our health and well-being by focusing on \"liking\" pleasure rather than \"wanting\" pleasure, by emphasizing meaningful experiences that provide genuine enjoyment and fulfillment, such as spending time with loved ones, engaging in hobbies, and pursuing personal goals. He also advocates for policy changes that can reduce the influence of consumerism and the food industry on our lives.</p> <p>Overall, \"The Hacking of the American Mind\" is a thought-provoking exploration of the impact of pleasure-seeking on our society and our health, and provides valuable insights into how we can improve our lives and our communities.</p> <p>Robert Lustig discusses the relationship between two neurotransmitters in the brain: dopamine and serotonin.</p> <p>Dopamine is often referred to as the \"reward neurotransmitter\" because it is released in response to pleasurable experiences such as eating delicious food, taking drugs, or having sex. Dopamine is associated with the \"wanting\" aspect of pleasure that drives us to seek out more of these experiences, even when they may not be good for us.</p> <p>On the other hand, serotonin is often referred to as the \"contentment neurotransmitter\" because it is associated with feelings of well-being and happiness. Serotonin is released when we engage in behaviors that promote long-term satisfaction, such as forming social connections, pursuing meaningful goals, and engaging in physical activity.</p> <p>Lustig argues that the modern lifestyle, with its emphasis on instant gratification and constant pleasure-seeking, has disrupted the balance between dopamine and serotonin in our brains. Overstimulation of the dopamine reward system can lead to addiction, anxiety, and depression, while a lack of serotonin can result in feelings of emptiness and dissatisfaction.</p> <p>Lustig suggests that we can restore this balance by focusing on behaviors that promote the release of serotonin, such as engaging in meaningful relationships, pursuing personal goals, and practicing mindfulness. He also emphasizes the importance of reducing the overstimulation of the dopamine reward system by limiting our exposure to addictive substances and activities, such as processed foods, drugs, and social media.</p> <p>In summary, Lustig draws a correlation between dopamine and serotonin, arguing that the modern emphasis on dopamine-based pleasure-seeking has disrupted the balance between these two neurotransmitters, which has negative effects on our mental and physical health. He suggests that we can restore this balance by prioritizing behaviors that promote the release of serotonin and limiting our exposure to addictive stimuli.</p> <p>Robert Lustig provides a bullet-point comparison between dopamine and serotonin, highlighting their differences in function and effects on our brains and bodies. Following is a summary of the comparison.</p> <p>Dopamine:</p> <ul> <li>Drives pleasure-seeking behaviors</li> <li>Associated with addiction and compulsion</li> <li>Activated by short-term, high-intensity stimulation</li> <li>Promotes impulsivity and risk-taking behavior</li> <li>Associated with stress and anxiety when overstimulated</li> <li>Can lead to depression when depleted</li> <li>Can be activated by drugs, junk food, and social media</li> </ul> <p>Serotonin:</p> <ul> <li>Promotes feelings of contentment and well-being</li> <li>Associated with long-term satisfaction and fulfillment</li> <li>Activated by behaviors that promote social connection, physical activity, and personal growth</li> <li>Promotes impulse control and emotional stability</li> <li>Associated with reduced stress and anxiety when activated</li> <li>Can lead to depression when depleted</li> <li>Can be activated by social connection, physical activity, and mindfulness practices</li> </ul> <p>Overall, Lustig suggests that a focus on dopamine-based pleasure-seeking, as promoted by modern consumer culture, can lead to imbalances in the brain that negatively affect our mental and physical health. Instead, he advocates for a shift towards behaviors that promote the release of serotonin, such as building meaningful relationships, pursuing personal goals, and engaging in activities that promote physical and mental well-being.</p>"},{"location":"other/Health/#other-pointers-unrelated-to-physical","title":"Other Pointers Unrelated to Physical","text":"<p>Is Tucker Carlson Believeable?</p> <p>America the greatest?</p> <p>Sidney Powell</p> <p>Law Enforcement</p> <p>America\u2019s \u2018Exceptional\u2019 Problem With Violence</p> <p>Tucker Carlson: Last Week Tonight</p> <p>The System: Who Rigged It, How We Fix It | Robert Reich</p> <p>Interview with Oklahoma State Sen.

That was sort-of my primary motivation for TightBytes - which sees pretty much no visitors ... whatever - and is what drives these pages.

Getting old makes one a bit forgetful, and I'll sometimes find myself out and about - away from my PC - trying to do something I absolutely Know how to do... yeah, but can't remember exactly how. Perhaps the reason I forget is because I use so many \"tools\". </p> <p>What do I mean by \"tools\"?</p> <p>These pages - the one's on Github, currently (2022) - were created (typed) in a program (free) called \"Brackets\". Note: I've since moved on to Phoenix Code. So, not in MS Word or on Notepad. The reason for that these apps are plain-text editors for programmers, which include some nice bells and whistles for programmers. The formatting codes aren't visible to the person reading the resultant page... thus::</p> <pre><code>    here is how I do ** bold** and *italic*\n</code></pre> <p>produces: here is how I do bold and italic</p> <p>The mechanisms used to use to write pages with were designed for Sphinx, which uses a markup language called reStructuredText as the default. Like in any language, programming 'languages' have certain rules so that you can pretty much get the same results all the time in a given environment. On the web, the most common 'language' is HTML:: <pre><code>    &lt;HTML&gt;\n    &lt;HEAD&gt; header content here\n    &lt;/HEAD&gt;\n\n    &lt;BODY&gt; body of the text here\n    &lt;/BODY&gt;\n    &lt;/HTML&gt;\n</code></pre></p> <p>A markup language allows you to insert formatting 'tags' right into the text itself. For example, in HTML the markup bit would be words enclosed by lesser-than and greater-than symbols. When you create the document the interpreter sees that as instructions on how the rest of the text should look or behave. Being comfortable in that \"language\" is just a matter of doing it enough, just like any other language.</p> <p>HTML is just one such markup language. reStructuredText is another. The current pages are formatted using markdown (MkDocs). I also write in VBA and Python... after a while, I've ended up needing a reference on how to do certain things in a language I hadn't used in a while.</p>"},{"location":"tech/OStuff/#html-and-css","title":"HTML and CSS","text":"<p>Grid for two simple layouts</p> <p>Slide Show</p> <p>Why people use CSS frameworks</p> <p>AstroDocs</p>"},{"location":"tech/OStuff/#other-help-tips","title":"Other Help Tips","text":""},{"location":"tech/OStuff/#changing-settings-in-chrome","title":"Changing Settings in Chrome","text":"<p>These tips pertain to Chrome for Mac: doesn't matter much which version of the Mac operating system, as far as I can tell.

Trump lacks certain qualities which the British traditionally esteem. For instance, he has no class, no charm, no coolness, no credibility, no compassion, no wit, no warmth, no wisdom, no subtlety, no sensitivity, no self-awareness, no humility, no honour and no grace \u2013 all qualities, funnily enough, with which his predecessor Mr. Obama was generously blessed.</p> <p>So for us, the stark contrast does rather throw Trump\u2019s limitations into embarrassingly sharp relief.</p> <p>Plus, we like a laugh. And while Trump may be laughable, he has never once said anything wry, witty or even faintly amusing \u2013 not once, ever. I don\u2019t say that rhetorically, I mean it quite literally: not once, not ever. And that fact is particularly disturbing to the British sensibility \u2013 for us, to lack humour is almost inhuman. But with Trump, it\u2019s a fact. He doesn\u2019t even seem to understand what a joke is \u2013 his idea of a joke is a crass comment, an illiterate insult, a casual act of cruelty.</p> <p>Trump is a troll. And like all trolls, he is never funny and he never laughs; he only crows or jeers. And scarily, he doesn\u2019t just talk in crude, witless insults \u2013 he actually thinks in them. His mind is a simple bot-like algorithm of petty prejudices and knee-jerk nastiness. There is never any under-layer of irony, complexity, nuance or depth. It\u2019s all surface.</p> <p>Some Americans might see this as refreshingly upfront.</p> <p>Well, we don\u2019t. We see it as having no inner world, no soul.</p> <p>And in Britain we traditionally side with David, not Goliath. All our heroes are plucky underdogs: Robin Hood, Dick Whittington, Oliver Twist. Trump is neither plucky, nor an underdog. He is the exact opposite of that. He\u2019s not even a spoiled rich-boy, or a greedy fat-cat. He\u2019s more a fat white slug. A Jabba the Hutt of privilege. And worse, he is that most unforgivable of all things to the British: a bully. That is, except when he is among bullies; then he suddenly transforms into a snivelling sidekick instead.</p> <p>There are unspoken rules to this stuff \u2013 the Queensberry rules of basic decency \u2013 and he breaks them all. He punches downwards \u2013 which a gentleman should, would, could never do \u2013 and every blow he aims is below the belt. He particularly likes to kick the vulnerable or voiceless \u2013 and he kicks them when they are down.</p> <p>So the fact that a significant minority \u2013 perhaps a third \u2013 of Americans look at what he does, listen to what he says, and then think \u2018Yeah, he seems like my kind of guy\u2019 is a matter of some confusion and no little distress to British people, given that:</p> <p>Americans are supposed to be nicer than us, and mostly are. You don\u2019t need a particularly keen eye for detail to spot a few flaws in the man. This last point is what especially confuses and dismays British people, and many other people too; his faults seem pretty bloody hard to miss. After all, it\u2019s impossible to read a single tweet, or hear him speak a sentence or two, without staring deep into the abyss. He turns being artless into an art form; he is a Picasso of pettiness; a Shakespeare of shit. His faults are fractal: even his flaws have flaws, and so on ad infinitum.</p> <p>God knows there have always been stupid people in the world, and plenty of nasty people too. But rarely has stupidity been so nasty, or nastiness so stupid. He makes Nixon look trustworthy and George W. look smart. In fact, if Frankenstein decided to make a monster assembled entirely from human flaws \u2013 he would make a Trump. And a remorseful Doctor Frankenstein would clutch out big clumpfuls of hair and scream in anguish:</p> <p>\u2018My God\u2026 what\u2026 have\u2026 I\u2026 created?\u2019</p> <p>If being a twat was a TV show, Trump would be the boxed set.\u201d</p> <p>Thank you Nate White.</p> <p>BTW:  Scientists don\u2019t think (assume) anything, they make no assumptions. Science is evidence-driven. There is a fallacy in this assertion.</p>"},{"location":"tech/OStuff/#vscode-search-tip","title":"VSCode Search Tip","text":"<p>In Visual Studio Code, you can use regular expressions (regex) to select all text between specific markers like \"startstart\" and \"endend\".

I went at once to the lawyers whose name was given in the paper.</p> <p>Now, this is Miss Violet Smith.</p> <p>The solicitor introduced me to two men, a Mr. Carruthers and a Mr. Woodley. They were on a visit from South Africa.</p> <p>I wish I could tell you your uncle left you a vast fortune, but as I said...</p> <p>He died in extreme poverty.</p> <p>However, I myself am not without means. My mother and I never sought charity.</p> <p>No, nor do I offer it.</p> <p>Please.</p> <p>I have a question to ask of you.</p> <p>Your Uncle Ralph said you were very musical, do you teach music?</p> <p>Yes.</p> <p>Miss Smith, I am now a widower with a ten-year-old daughter.</p> <p>Young Sarah.</p> <p>She needs a music teacher. So, you see, I do not offer charity.</p> <p>A job, he wants to give you a job!</p> <p>Whereabouts in London do you live, Mr. Carruthers?</p> <p>I don't. I live about six miles from Farnham, in Surrey, at Chiltern Grange.</p> <p>I couldn't possibly leave my mother on her own.</p> <p>I will pay you one-hundred pounds a year.</p> <p>A hundred a year?</p> <p>Yes.</p> <p>HOLMES: Approximately double the market price, I think.</p> <p>Oh, at least!</p> <p>HOLMES: Which you obviously accepted, or you wouldn't be here now.</p> <p>Yes.</p> <p>I accepted the offer.

You want diamonds,oh, I can give you diamonds.</p> <p>I don't want diamonds!</p> <p>Oh, you think about it.

Oh, it may be a mere fancy of mine, but it seems to me that Mr. Carruthers shows a great deal of interest in me. Oh, he has never said anything, he is a perfect gentleman, but, a girl always knows.</p> <p>HOLMES: So I believe. And I assume that these feelings that you sense from Mr. Carruthers are not reciprocated?</p> <p>He is a kind and generous employer, but I am already engaged.</p> <p>HOLMES: Oh, the name of this very fortunate young man is?!</p> <p>Cyril Morton.

You seem well capable of protecting yourself.</p> <p>Please, help me, Mr. Holmes!</p> <p>HOLMES: What is it?</p> <p>I am being followed.</p> <p>HOLMES: Followed, by whom?</p> <p>A cyclist. Every Saturday morning I bicycle from the house to Farnham Station to catch the twelve-twenty-two to town. There is one very quiet and lonely stretch of road that lies between Charlington Heath on the one hand and the woods of Charlington Hall on the other. Two weeks ago today, I was passing this place when I chanced to look back and saw a man, also on a bicycle. The following Monday when I returned he was there again.</p> <p>HOLMES: I see.</p> <p>And again last Saturday, and again last Monday.</p> <p>HOLMES: Have you mentioned this to your employer?</p> <p>Yes. Mr. Carruthers was very concerned, and has ordered a horse and trap so that in the future I should not travel unaccompanied. But they've not yet arrived.</p> <p>HOLMES: And this morning?</p> <p>He was following me again. I slowed down, but he did the same. Then I stopped completely, but he did the same. So, I laid a trap for him. There is a sharp turning of the road, and I pedaled very quickly towards this and then stopped and waited. But he seemed to disappear into thin air.</p> <p>HOLMES: Can you describe this man? I realize that you've only seen him from a distance.</p> <p>Yes. He wears a dark suit, dark spectacles, and he has a beard.</p> <p>HOLMES: Young, old?</p> <p>He's about middle-aged.</p> <p>HOLMES: Now, let me see if I have the geography correct. Here is the road, with a sharp bend in it here. On this side, Charlington Heath, and on the other, the woods of Charlington Hall. How long did you wait for him here around the bend?</p> <p>Oh, no more than two minutes.</p> <p>HOLMES: So he could not have retreated back down the road. Are there any side roads?</p> <p>None along this stretch.</p> <p>HOLMES: Could he have taken a footpath across the heath?</p> <p>Oh, the heath is totally flat and bleak. I think I would have noticed him.</p> <p>HOLMES: So, by a process of exclusion, we arrive at the fact that he made his way towards Charlington Hall. Now how does Mr. Carruthers make his living?</p> <p>Oh, he's a rich man.</p> <p>HOLMES: But no carriages or horses.</p> <p>Well, at least he's very well off. He goes into the city two or three times a week, and he sometimes refers to his gold shares.</p> <p>HOLMES: Yes, I see. You must let me know immediately if there are any fresh developments. I am extremely busy just now, but I will find time to make inquiries into your case.</p> <p>Thank you, Mr. Holmes.</p> <p>HOLMES: In the meantime, take no step without letting me know.</p> <p>WATSON: I'm sure we shall have nothing but good news for you.</p> <p>I do hope so, Dr. Watson.</p> <p>WATSON: Very lovely girl.</p> <p>HOLMES: Yes. And it is part of the settled order of nature that such a girl should have followers, but for choice, not on bicycles in lonely country roads.</p> <p>WATSON: You really think she may be in some danger, Holmes?</p> <p>HOLMES: Oh, yes.</p> <p>WATSON: On the following Monday, Holmes found that he had business which detained him in London, so he dispatched me on the early train to Farnham that I might observe Miss Smith's passage past Charlington Hall. The setting was just as she had described, heavily wooded on the side bordering the hall and utterly exposed on the other. I selected the only available cover and waited.</p> <p>HOLMES: Watson, you have wasted your time.</p> <p>WATSON: I thought I did rather well.</p> <p>HOLMES: No, your hiding place was ill-chosen. You should have been in the bracken on the other side of the road. Then that way you would have had a close view of this fascinating solitary cyclist.</p> <p>Thank you.</p> <p>As it is, you were a hundred yards away and can tell me even less than Miss Smith reported to us last Saturday. You describe him as bending low over the handle bar?</p> <p>WATSON: Yes, quite low.</p> <p>HOLMES: Thus concealment again, which in your case worked perfectly. Oh no, you really have done remarkably badly. He goes back to the Hall and you come all the way back to London to call on a house agent.</p> <p>WATSON: Well, I found the information I was seeking.</p> <p>HOLMES: You found the name Williamson, which conveys nothing to my mind.</p> <p>WATSON: Well, we know he's elderly and respectable.</p> <p>HOLMES: And therefore, unlikely to be the energetic cyclist that sprints away from that athletic young girl.</p> <p>WATSON: Well, what should I have done?</p> <p>HOLMES: Gone to the nearest public house. That is the center of country gossip. They would have given you every name from the master to the scullery maid. Instead of which, you give me... Williamson. So, what have we gained by your expedition. The fact that the girl's story is true; I never doubted that. That there is a connection between the cyclist and the Hall; I never doubted that, either. The Hall is tenanted by a man called Williamson. Who is the better for that?</p> <p>WATSON: I shall go back tomorrow and visit the public house.</p> <p>HOLMES: No, my dear sir, do not commit yourself to rashness because you are temporarily depressed. We can do nothing useful until Saturday.</p> <p>WATSON: Did I really do remarkably badly?</p> <p>HOLMES: Yes.</p> <p>Very beautiful.</p> <p>Thank you, Mr. Carruthers. It is a new piece. I need to practice it more.</p> <p>No, I don't mean the music. Violet, I have a question to ask you.</p> <p>WATSON: Morning, Holmes.</p> <p>HOLMES: A letter from Miss Violet Smith. Now Carruthers has proposed marriage to her.</p> <p>WATSON: Carruthers!</p> <p>HOLMES: Gentlemen are permitted to propose marriage, Watson. Of course he didn't know about Cyril.</p> <p>WATSON: Are you going to Farnham?</p> <p>HOLMES: I want to test one or two theories which I have formed.</p> <p>WATSON: Shall I come with you?</p> <p>HOLMES: No, that will be neither useful nor necessary.</p> <p>WATSON: Try the nearest public house, always a good center for country gossip.</p> <p>HOLMES: Thank you, Watson, capital notion!</p> <p>HOLMES: Ah, Good afternoon, Landlord. May I have half a pint of your local ale, please?</p> <p>Certainly, sir. Here you are.</p> <p>HOLMES: Thank you. You may keep the change.</p> <p>That's most generous of you, sir, but I couldn't. I haven't done anything to warrant such generosity.</p> <p>HOLMES: I'm about to give you the opportunity. I need some information.</p> <p>Oh, I'm not one for idle gossip, sir.</p> <p>HOLMES: Neither am I, I prefer facts. Tell me about the people at Charlington Hall.</p> <p>You mean Mr. Williamson, sir?</p> <p>HOLMES: Yes.</p> <p>Well, he... he was in here not more than five minutes ago. You just missed him.</p> <p>HOLMES: Tell me about Mr. Williamson. Is he an elderly, respectable gentleman?</p> <p>Oh, he's elderly, no doubt. Far be it from me to speak ill of people behind their backs, but I'm none too sure about respectable.</p> <p>HOLMES: Really?</p> <p>He is an ex-clergymen, I reckon.</p> <p>HOLMES: Ex?</p> <p>Apparently. He was struck off, or whatever it is happens to clergymen.</p> <p>HOLMES: That's doctors that are struck off. Tell me about the other people up at the house.</p> <p>Well, they're just domestic staff, and they're all local and God-fearing.</p> <p>HOLMES: Of course.</p> <p>He do have folk up there at weekends.</p> <p>HOLMES: Weekends?</p> <p>Yes, sir. Weekends.</p> <p>HOLMES: Ah, no problem. What sort of folk?</p> <p>Oh, they're a warm lot.</p> <p>HOLMES: Warm?</p> <p>Yes, the sort you don't want to get too near for fear of getting burnt like.</p> <p>HOLMES: That's good.</p> <p>Oh, you may think it's good, sir. They don't come down well in the village, I can tell you. There was one fellow in particular.</p> <p>HOLMES: Particularly warm, is he, this fellow?</p> <p>He is very particularly, sir.</p> <p>HOLMES: I'll wager he has a red mustache.</p> <p>Hey, do you know him?</p> <p>HOLMES: I never met the gentleman.</p> <p>Well, now is your chance.</p> <p>HOLMES: Mr. Woodley.</p> <p>None of your damn business!</p> <p>HOLMES: Our Landlord keeps a very respectable house, and your language is not welcome.</p> <p>Who do you think you are? What the hell do you want coming here asking all them questions?</p> <p>HOLMES: You're quite right, Landlord, clearly not a gentleman.</p> <p>Oh, I'm as much a gentleman as you are.</p> <p>HOLMES: Everybody here will bear witness to the fact that I am acting in self-defense.</p> <p>Swine!</p> <p>HOLMES: No, sir, a gentleman! Only a ruffian deals a blow with the back of a hand. A gentleman uses the straight... left... and I, sir, am a gentleman!</p> <p>HOLMES: It was absolutely delicious, Watson.</p> <p>WATSON: So I see.</p> <p>HOLMES: A straight left against a slogging ruffian. I emerged, as you see.</p> <p>WATSON: And the slogging ruffian?</p> <p>HOLMES: Mr. Woodley was taken home in a cart.</p> <p>There's that horrible man again.</p> <p>Which man?</p> <p>I thought I saw Mr. Woodley in the garden today.</p> <p>You did. He's staying in the area. But do not worry, I have told him quite firmly he's not to set foot inside the house.</p> <p>HOLMES: \"Dear Mr. Holmes: You will not be surprised to learn that I will be leaving Mr. Carruthers's employment on Saturday.\" The odious Mr. Woodley has reappeared at Chiltern Grange.</p> <p>WATSON: Ah, but at least she won't be bicycling to the station. So finally, the rich Mr. Carruthers has acquired a horse and trap.</p> <p>HOLMES: Yes.</p> <p>WATSON: Look here, \"all my troubles will be over on Saturday.\" Tomorrow, Holmes, all her troubles will be over.</p> <p>HOLMES: Why do I worry about that word.</p> <p>WATSON: Which word?</p> <p>HOLMES: \"Trap.\"</p> <p>WATSON: Oh, what a splendid morning, Holmes!</p> <p>HOLMES: It's acceptable weather for the time of year.</p> <p>WATSON: Now who would want to harm that dear girl on such a morning?</p> <p>HOLMES: I hope nobody.</p> <p>WATSON: So why did you bring your revolver?</p> <p>HOLMES: I'm talking about my hope, not my expectations.</p> <p>WATSON: What?</p> <p>HOLMES: I fancy that is our Miss Smith. She must be traveling by an earlier train. I give her a margin of half an hour, but she'll be past Charlington Hall before we can possibly meet her.</p> <p>WATSON: So what can we do?</p> <p>HOLMES: We could run. Fool, I should have allowed for that earlier train! It's abduction, Watson, it's abduction, murder, heaven knows what. Stop that horse. Good man. Come on, Watson! Let's see if I can repair the consequences of my own blunder!</p> <p>Up there!</p> <p>WATSON: Holmes.</p> <p>Where did you get that cart?!</p> <p>HOLMES: Where is Miss Violet Smith?!</p> <p>That's what I'm asking you. You were in her cart!</p> <p>It was on the road, there was no one in it!</p> <p>HOLMES: Somebody seems to have gone through this way! We must find them! Come, Watson. Now look, do you know who this is?! That's Peter, the groom, he was taking her to the station. He's alive, his pulse is strong. Mustn't be left lying there too long.</p> <p>HOLMES: Let him lie, we can't do him any good, but we might save her from the worst fate that can befall a woman.</p> <p>Where are you going?!</p> <p>The house!</p> <p>HOLMES: They didn't go to the house! They went this way to the left.</p> <p>WATSON: Are you sure?</p> <p>Oh, cowardly dogs!</p> <p>Too late!</p> <p>Watson.</p> <p>Too late by the living Jingo!</p> <p>For as much as John and Violet have consented together in holy wedlock, and have witnessed the same before God and this company... and have declared the same by the giving and receiving of a ring, and the joining of hands, I pronounce that they be man and wife, together. Congratulations!</p> <p>Thanks, amen.</p> <p>WATSON: They're married!</p> <p>Welcome to the party, gentlemen. Let me introduce you to Mrs. Woodley.</p> <p>HOLMES: Don't Carruthers!</p> <p>WATSON: Carruthers!</p> <p>Yes, and I'll see this woman righted, if I have to swing for it.</p> <p>You're too late. She is my wife!</p> <p>No, she's your widow. I told you what I'd do if you molested her! By the Lord, I'm a man of my word!</p> <p>When you hired me, nobody told me there'd be any of this damn nonsense!</p> <p>HOLMES: Drop that pistol. Watson, pick it up! Give me that revolver, we'll have no more violence.</p> <p>Who are you to be giving these orders?</p> <p>HOLMES: Sherlock Holmes.</p> <p>Good Lord.</p> <p>HOLMES: Here, you!</p> <p>Sir?</p> <p>HOLMES: Are you well enough to drive into Farnham?</p> <p>Yes, sir, I reckon I am.</p> <p>HOLMES: Then give this note to the superintendent of the police station. In the meantime, I must detain you all under my own personal custody.</p> <p>How are the patients, Doctor?</p> <p>WATSON: Miss Smith's very well, considering the foul way she's been treated.</p> <p>HOLMES: And Woodley?</p> <p>WATSON: Alas, I have no doubt he will live.</p> <p>What!?! I'll go upstairs and finish him off.</p> <p>HOLMES: No, sit down in that chair, Carruthers.</p> <p>You're right. He isn't worth swinging for. But do you tell me that girl is to be tied to Roaring Jack Woodley for life?!</p> <p>HOLMES: You needn't concern yourself about that.</p> <p>I married them till death do them part.</p> <p>HOLMES: Under no circumstances can she be considered his wife.</p> <p>Are you sure?</p> <p>HOLMES: For two very good reasons. In the first place, we are very safe in questioning Mr. Williamson's right to solemnize a marriage.</p> <p>I have been ordained.</p> <p>HOLMES: And unfrocked.</p> <p>Once a clergyman, always a clergyman.</p> <p>HOLMES: I think not. How about the license?</p> <p>Oh, we had a license. I have it here.</p> <p>HOLMES: Undoubtedly obtained by a trick. But, in any case, a forced marriage is no marriage, indeed, it is a very serious felony, as you will discover. Now, while we are waiting for the police, Mr. Carruthers, you might tell me your story.</p> <p>If you squeal on us, Bob Carruthers, I'll serve you as you served Jack Woodley!</p> <p>HOLMES: There's no need for you to get over-excited. The case is clear enough.</p> <p>Well, if it's clear enough, why don't you tell us.</p> <p>HOLMES: Very well. Mr. Carruthers will have to fill in a few details for my private curiosity, but I am happy to do the talking. In the first place, the three of you came across from South Africa.</p> <p>Wrong, I've never even been in South Africa!</p> <p>It's true. Woodley acquired this creature after our return.</p> <p>HOLMES: Very well, you and Woodley had known Ralph Smith in South Africa. You had reason to believe that he would not live long, and you found out that his niece would inherit his fortune.</p> <p>How's that? But you told the girl her uncle died in poverty.</p> <p>HOLMES: Well, as he was still alive, admittedly only just, and a wealthy man who I suspect had made no will. Ralph Smith could neither read nor write. So, you and Woodley came over here and hunted up the girl, knowing she was the next of kin, and that you would share the plunder.</p> <p>I was due a share for services rendered.</p> <p>HOLMES: And Carruthers, you made the mistake of falling in love with her.</p> <p>The first time that ever I knew what love was, Mr. Holmes.</p> <p>HOLMES: Why didn't you tell her of the danger she was in?</p> <p>Because... because she would have left me, and I couldn't bear to face that. Oh, what will happen to my daughter, Sarah?</p> <p>HOLMES: We'll see she's well taken care of.</p> <p>You see, even if she couldn't love me, it meant a great deal to see her about the house and hear the sound of her voice.</p> <p>WATSON: You may call it love, Mr. Carruthers, I should call it selfishness.</p> <p>Maybe the two things go together. But I tried to protect her, I never once let her go past this house where I knew those rascals were lurking without following her on my bicycle to see she came to no harm. I kept my distance and wore that beard so she should not recognize me.</p> <p>HOLMES: Then I presume the cable arrived?</p> <p>WATSON: Cable, what cable?</p> <p>\"THE OLD MAN IS DEAD.\"</p> <p>WATSON: What old man?</p> <p>HOLMES: I imagine Ralph Smith in South Africa.</p> <p>Yes.</p> <p>HOLMES: But by this time you and Woodley had quarreled and he had left the house.</p> <p>Woodley came back again to ask me to stick to the bargain. I refused. I said I would have nothing to do with violence.</p> <p>HOLMES: One last detail, why was Woodley chosen as the prospective husband?</p> <p>I am ashamed to say it... we played cards for her.</p> <p>WATSON: Holmes, I have the results of the trial. Listen to this, the judge in summing up said... Holmes?</p> <p>HOLMES: Watson, may I be permitted an educated guess?</p> <p>WATSON: Go on then.</p> <p>HOLMES: I would expect Woodley to get ten years, Williamson seven years, and Carruthers, in view of the eloquent speech I made on his behalf at the trial, probably six months.</p> <p>WATSON: That is exactly right!</p> <p>HOLMES: Well, I have certain advantages, Watson, largely the fact that I sent out for the early edition.</p> <p>WATSON: An undoubted advantage.</p> <p>HOLMES: Also, we have received a present, some wedding cake from Mr. and Mrs. Cyril Morton, together with a letter telling us that Mrs. Morton has inherited a large sum of money from her uncle, Ralph Smith, formerly of South Africa. The happy couple are thoroughly enjoying looking after young Sarah Carruthers, while her father is in custody. Her piano playing is improving and she wants to take up bicycling.</p> <p>WATSON: A splendid day all round, wouldn't you say?</p> <p>HOLMES: There is more splendor yet to come.</p> <p>WATSON: More splendor, what do you mean?</p> <p>HOLMES: Watch carefully.</p> <p>WATSON: Oh, I remember, the chemical reaction that will solve the mystery concerning the persecution of Mr. John Vincent Harden.</p> <p>HOLMES: Precisely. I've spent the entire week in the lmperial Science Museum and I think this is the answer.</p> <p>WATSON: Is that the answer, Holmes?</p> <p>HOLMES: Yes, that is the answer, Watson.</p> <p>WATSON: Well, let me think.</p>"},{"location":"tech/VScripts/#the-norwood-builder","title":"THE NORWOOD BUILDER","text":"<p>MCU: Door of tobacconist</p> <p>WATSON: Thank you, George.</p> <p>HOLMES: From the point of view of the criminal expert, London has become a singularly uninteresting city.</p> <p>WATSON: Well, I hardly think you'll find many decent citizens to agree with you.</p> <p>HOLMES: Well, well, well, one must not be selfish. The community's the gain, and no one the loser save the poor, unfortunate specialist whose occupation was forgotten.</p> <p>WATSON: You must have been totally uneventful, surely... There's the case of the papers of ex-President Murillo... and shocking affair of the Dutch steamship Treesman which very nearly cost us both our lives. Both of them great successes.</p> <p>MRS HUDSON: I'm sorry, Mr. Holmes is not at home.</p> <p>JH MCFARLANE: If I fail to see him now, it will be too late.</p> <p>MRS HUDSON: But I'm sorry, I cannot help you.</p> <p>JH MCFARLANE: But it is a matter of the utmost urgency.</p> <p>MRS HUDSON: I have already told you, young man... Mr. Holmes.</p> <p>JH MCFARLANE: Mr. Holmes! Well, I must see you.</p> <p>MRS HUDSON: I told the young man you weren't here, but he wouldn't listen.</p> <p>JH MCFARLANE: I'm sorry, I'm sorry, but I'm nearly out of my mind. I am the unhappy John Hector McFarlane.</p> <p>HOLMES: Now, tell us quietly and slowly who you are and what it is that you want. But you mentioned your name just now as if I should recognize it, but I can assure you, beyond the obvious facts that you are a bachelor, a solicitor and a free mason and an asthmatic, I know nothing about you whatever.</p> <p>WATSON: Your untidy clothes, sheaf of legal papers, watch chain and your somewhat irregular breathing.</p> <p>JH MCFARLANE:  Why, yes, Mr. Holmes, I am all these things. And in addition, I am at this moment, the most unfortunate man in London. I mean, have you not read your newspaper?</p> <p>WATSON: Not yet.</p> <p>JH MCFARLANE: Then, if you would allow me.</p> <p>WATSON: \"At about twelve o'clock last night, an instance occurred at Lower Norwood which points, it is feared, to a serious crime. A small timber yard caught fire at the back of a house belonging to Mr. Jonas Oldacre, a builder. Surprise was expressed at Mr. Oldacre's absence, and it became apparent he had disappeared. An examination of his room revealed a safe which was open, signs of a murderous struggle, and a heavy walking stick with stains of blood upon the handle.\"</p> <p>JH MCFARLANE: All I ask is that you don't abandon me. A man has followed me from London Bridge Station. If they arrest me before I finish my story, make them give me time so that I may tell you the whole truth. I could go to jail happy if I knew that you were outside working for me.</p> <p>HOLMES: Arrest you? This is really most gratifying. On what charge do you expect to be arrested?</p> <p>JH MCFARLANE: Upon the charge of murdering Mr. Jonas Oldacre of Lower Norwood.</p> <p>HOLMES: Dear me!</p> <p>WATSON: \"As we go to press, sensational developments have been reported. Charred remains have been found among the ashes of the fire, and the police theory is that the victim was clubbed to death and the body ignited. It is known that Mr. Oldacre received a visitor last night, and the stick has been identified as belonging to that person a young London solicitor, by the name of John Hector McFarlane.\"</p> <p>HOLMES: May I ask why you are still at liberty, Mr. McFarlane, as there seems to be enough evidence to justify your arrest?</p> <p>JH MCFARLANE:  I live with my mother, at Torrington Lodge in Blackheath, but last night, having late business with Mr. Oldacre, I stayed at a hotel in Norwood. Mr. Holmes, I knew nothing of this affair until I was on the train to my office this morning and read what you have just heard. I saw at once the terrible danger of my position and hurried to put the case in your hands.</p> <p>HOLMES: Ah, Inspector Lestrade, we have been expecting you.</p> <p>LESTRADE: Mr. Holmes. Dr. Watson. Mr. John Hector McFarlane?</p> <p>JH MCFARLANE:  Yes.</p> <p>LESTRADE: I arrest you for the willful murder of Mr. Jonas Oldacre of Lower Norwood.</p> <p>HOLMES: Hold up, just one moment. A half an hour more or less could make little difference to you, and this young gentleman was about to give us an account of this very interesting affair which might aid us in clearing it up.</p> <p>LESTRADE: There will be no difficulty in clearing it up, thank you, Mr. Holmes.</p> <p>HOLMES: Nevertheless, I think, with your permission, I would be much interested in hearing his account.</p> <p>LESTRADE: Well, Mr. Holmes, there's no denying that you have been of use to the force once or twice in the past, but I must insist...</p> <p>JH MCFARLANE: All I ask is that you should hear and recognize the absolute truth.</p> <p>LESTRADE: I'll give you half an hour.</p> <p>HOLMES: Sit down, McFarlane. Thank you, Lestrade. We must warn you with what you say now will appear in evidence against you. Pray continue.</p> <p>JH MCFARLANE: I must first explain that I knew nothing of Mr. Jonas Oldacre, although his name was familiar to me. Many years ago, my parents were acquainted with him, but, well, they drifted apart. And so it came as a complete surprise when yesterday afternoon, at about 3 o'clock, he walked into my office in the city.</p> <p>JH MCFARLANE: Mr. Oldacre, good afternoon, I'm Mr. McFarlane. Would you care to come through? Please, won't you sit down? How can I help you?</p> <p>OLDACRE: This is a draft of my Will. I want you, Mr. McFarlane, to cast it into proper legal shape. I shall sit here while you do so.</p> <p>JH MCFARLANE: You can understand my astonishment, Mr. Holmes, when I found that, with some minor reservations, his entire estate had been left to me.</p> <p>JH MCFARLANE: But I... I simply don't understand.</p> <p>OLDACRE: Well, then, let me explain. I'm a bachelor, Mr. McFarlane, with few relatives, and none who deserve my consideration.</p> <p>JH MCFARLANE: Well, that may well be so...</p> <p>OLDACRE: Let me... let me finish.</p> <p>JH MCFARLANE: I beg your pardon.</p> <p>OLDACRE: For many years now, I've withdrawn from my business. I was a builder, and though I say it myself, an extremely successful one. Successful enough to have gained considerable wealth and thus live out my life in complete, if solitary, comfort. Many years ago, I knew your mother. Knew her, and hoped to marry her. Then she met and married your father.</p> <p>JH MCFARLANE: I had no idea.</p> <p>OLDACRE: Well, and why should you? Three months ago, why, I read of your father's death in The Daily Telegraph and my mind was turned to your mother and to the son who might very well have been my own. This is my way of securing your future. I know that whatever I leave will be in worthy hands.</p> <p>JH MCFARLANE: What can I say, but thank you?</p> <p>OLDACRE: There are a few documents I think you should see, building leases, title deeds, mortgages and so on. Well, now my mind's made up, I shan't rest easy until the whole thing's settled. I beg you to come to my house tonight. What shall we say, nine o'clock?</p> <p>JH MCFARLANE: Why, yes.</p> <p>OLDACRE: You'll of course bring the finalized Will, and then we can settle the matter once and for all. Thank you, my boy. Oh, one last thing. Not a word of this to your dear mother until everything is settled. I want it to be a little surprise for her.</p> <p>JH MCFARLANE: Little? I-</p> <p>OLDACRE: You... you promise?</p> <p>JH MCFARLANE: You have my word.</p> <p>JH MCFARLANE: I left in good time for my appointment. But had difficulty in finding the house. So that it was nearly half-past before I reached it.</p> <p>JH MCFARLANE: Good evening I have an appointment with Mr. Oldacre.</p> <p>Mr. McFarlane?</p> <p>JH MCFARLANE: Yes, that's right.</p> <p>JH MCFARLANE: It was not the warmest of receptions. And the house itself had a peculiar, unloved feeling.</p> <p>OLDACRE: Sorry to keep you waiting, my boy.</p> <p>JH MCFARLANE: Not at all, sir. I'm a little late, I'm afraid.</p> <p>OLDACRE: Now, you brought the papers?</p> <p>JH MCFARLANE: Yes, indeed.</p> <p>OLDACRE: Excellent.</p> <p>JH MCFARLANE: The bedroom was on the ground floor where there was a large safe.</p> <p>OLDACRE: Bring the rest of those papers, my boy. Now, to business. All done?</p> <p>JH MCFARLANE: Yes, sir, all done.</p> <p>OLDACRE: Just seen the time, my boy. You must get home.</p> <p>JH MCFARLANE: Oh, thank you. I had a stick with me.</p> <p>OLDACRE: Ah, I wonder where she put it?</p> <p>JH MCFARLANE: A rather heavy walking stick. It belonged to my father.</p> <p>OLDACRE: Ah, never mind, I'll take good care of it until we meet again. After all, I shall be seeing a great deal of you now, I hope.</p> <p>JH MCFARLANE: Indeed you shall, sir.</p> <p>JH MCFARLANE:  I left him there. The safe was open, and the documents were on his desk. It was too late to go back to Blackheath, and so I spent the night at an hotel in Norwood. I knew nothing more of this horrible affair until this morning.</p> <p>HOLMES: Do you have the original draft of the Will that Oldacre brought to you?</p> <p>JH MCFARLANE: Why, yes, I... I have it here.</p> <p>HOLMES: May I retain this for twenty-four hours, Inspector?</p> <p>LESTRADE: If it would amuse you. Well, anything more you'd like to ask, Mr. Holmes?</p> <p>HOLMES: Not until I've been to Blackheath.</p> <p>LESTRADE: You mean Norwood?</p> <p>HOLMES: No doubt, that is what I must have meant.</p> <p>LESTRADE: Now, Mr. McFarlane, my Constable's at the door, there's a four-wheeler waiting. Morning, gentlemen.</p> <p>WATSON: Morning.</p> <p>HOLMES: There are certain points about this document, are there not Watson?</p> <p>WATSON: Well, I can read the first two lines and these in the middle of the second page and one or two at the end, I mean, they're as clear as print but the writing in between is very bad, and there's several places where I can't read it at all.</p> <p>HOLMES: What do make of that?</p> <p>WATSON: What do you make of it?</p> <p>HOLMES: That it was written on the train. The good writing represents stations, the bad writing movement, and the very bad writing...</p> <p>WATSON: Passing over the points?</p> <p>HOLMES: A scientific expert would pronounce at once that it was drawn up on a suburban line, since nowhere, save in the immediate vicinity of a great city, could there be so quick a succession of points. Granting that his whole journey was occupied in drawing up the Will then the train must have been an express, stopping only once between Norwood and London Bridge.</p> <p>WATSON: Yes, but it's curious, is it not, that a man should draw up so important a document in so haphazard a fashion?</p> <p>HOLMES: And it suggests that he thought it was going to be of no practical importance.</p> <p>WATSON: Well, he drew up his death warrant at the same time.</p> <p>HOLMES: This case is not clear to me. Come, Watson!</p> <p>WATSON: Where are we going? Norwood?</p> <p>HOLMES: No, Blackheath. Come!</p> <p>MRS MCFARLANE: My son's the gentlest creature on God's earth. It's inconceivable he could even contemplate such a terrible crime. He didn't even know the man, Mr. Holmes.</p> <p>HOLMES: But you did, Mrs. McFarlane.</p> <p>MRS MCFARLANE: Years ago. I'd forgotten that he ever existed. I tried to forget. It's impossible to quite forget a man like Jonas Oldacre. Yes, I knew him well. At one time, we were engaged to be married. Thank heaven I had the sense to turn away from him and marry a better, if poorer, man. Oh, please.</p> <p>HOLMES: Your husband died recently?</p> <p>MRS MCFARLANE: He was a kind man, gentle man. He was everything Jonas Oldacre was not.</p> <p>HOLMES: And yet, at one time, you were prepared to marry him?</p> <p>MRS MCFARLANE: I said that I knew him well but the more I knew of him, the more I came to realize I knew him not at all. He would change suddenly, what I saw frighted me. There was a dark side to his character, Mr. Holmes. A desire to cause pain. My own photograph. It was my first present to him.</p> <p>WATSON: Good heavens!</p> <p>MRS MCFARLANE: That was how it was returned to me on my wedding day. Together with a vile note urging a curse upon my house and saying he'd never forgive me.</p> <p>WATSON: And yet, he does seem to have forgiven you - after all, to leave his entire estate to your son.</p> <p>MRS MCFARLANE: Neither my son nor I want anything from that wicked man, dead or alive.</p> <p>HOLMES: Mrs. McFarlane, the fact remains that the Will was made.</p> <p>MRS MCFARLANE: I simply can't understand it. Why?</p> <p>HOLMES: Had you ever spoken of Oldacre to your son? I mean, perhaps told him what you've just told me now?</p> <p>MRS MCFARLANE: No, never.</p> <p>HOLMES: Never?</p> <p>MRS MCFARLANE: He found the photograph. My husband tried to make light of it, but he insisted. My husband told him something of the truth, that's all.</p> <p>WATSON: And the boy was disturbed?</p> <p>MRS MCFARLANE: He was upset, naturally.</p> <p>HOLMES: You see, Mrs. McFarlane, what the police might say is: that he had heard of Oldacre's behavior toward you. It would pre-dispose him toward hatred and violence. And so that case against him would be considerably strengthened.</p> <p>MRS MCFARLANE: No. There is a God in heaven, Mr. Holmes, and that same God who's punished that wicked man will show in his own good time, my son's hands are guiltless of his blood.</p> <p>WATSON: Wait here, please.</p> <p>LESTRADE: Ah! Mr. Holmes, Dr. Watson. We're just clearing up.</p> <p>HOLMES: The Will as promised.</p> <p>LESTRADE: Look!</p> <p>HOLMES: Buttons!</p> <p>LESTRADE: Trouser buttons. No doubt, you've brought your glass with you? The name is Hiams. According to Mrs. Lexington, the housekeeper, Hiams, is the name of Mr. Oldacre's tailor.</p> <p>WATSON: Presumably, the organic remains have been removed to the laboratory?</p> <p>LESTRADE: They have, Doctor, though they'll be of little use, I suspect. The poor devil was no more than bone and cinder.</p> <p>HOLMES: How very convenient for the murderer.</p> <p>LESTRADE: Not, I might venture, for Mr. Oldacre.</p> <p>HOLMES: Nevertheless, Inspector, bones... cinder.</p> <p>WATSON: Thank heavens, he was wearing his trousers.</p> <p>LESTRADE: This stick belongs to the accused, and he's never denied it.</p> <p>HOLMES: He says that he could not find it when he came to leave the house.</p> <p>LESTRADE: Says, Mr. Holmes, says. My experts made out footmarks of both men on the carpet.</p> <p>HOLMES: And too much subsequent traffic to make any examination on my part worthwhile.</p> <p>LESTRADE: Two sets of footmarks, Mr. Holmes. None of any third person.</p> <p>HOLMES: Another trick for your side. I suppose all these papers are from the safe?</p> <p>LESTRADE: Correct.</p> <p>HOLMES: And nothing, absolutely nothing, has been removed?</p> <p>LESTRADE: Nothing whatsoever. We have opened one or two, as you can see, to check the contents.</p> <p>HOLMES: May I check them?</p> <p>LESTRADE: By all means. I, myself, have business at The Yard.</p> <p>HOLMES: I would like to see the housekeeper, what is her name, Mrs. Lexington?</p> <p>LESTRADE: She'll add nothing more to what you already know.</p> <p>HOLMES: Nevertheless.</p> <p>LESTRADE: I'll send her in.</p> <p>HOLMES: Could it be that for once Lestrade is on the right track? All my instincts are one way, and all the facts are the other.</p> <p>MRS LEXINGTON: You wish to see me, sir?</p> <p>HOLMES: Yes Mrs. Lexington, this is my friend and colleague, Dr. Watson. Do sit down.</p> <p>MRS LEXINGTON: I'll stand, if I may. This room has no comfort for me.</p> <p>HOLMES: You let young Mr. McFarlane into this house at 9:30?</p> <p>MRS LEXINGTON: Yes. I wish that my hand had withered before I'd done so.</p> <p>HOLMES: And you retired to bed at?</p> <p>MRS LEXINGTON: 20 minutes past 11:00.</p> <p>WATSON: 20 minutes past 11:00. </p> <p>HOLMES: And you heard nothing?</p> <p>MRS LEXINGTON: My room is at the far end of the house. I heard nothing until the fire alarm sounded. It was then, only then, that I realized my poor master had been murdered.</p> <p>HOLMES: Mrs. Lexington, to your knowledge, did your master have any enemies?</p> <p>MRS LEXINGTON: Every man has his enemies.</p> <p>WATSON: And a businessman like Mr. Oldacre, more than most, perhaps?</p> <p>MRS LEXINGTON: He was a well-respected gentleman who kept himself very much to himself.</p> <p>HOLMES: Do you know anything about these papers?</p> <p>MRS LEXINGTON: I know nothing of Mr. Oldacre's private affairs.</p> <p>HOLMES: The buttons that the police found in the fire?</p> <p>MRS LEXINGTON: My master had three suits made by Mr. Hiams - two are still in that wardrobe there, and the third he was wearing that night.</p> <p>HOLMES: Thank you, Mrs. Lexington, you have been most cooperative. What do you make of her?</p> <p>WATSON: Tight as wax, if you ask me, but then, perhaps that's her usual manner?</p> <p>HOLMES: It's all wrong, I feel it in my bones. Something - something has not come out, and that woman knows it.</p> <p>WATSON: Holmes, would you like me to have a look at these papers? Well, a man's bank account can tell us as much as his diary.</p> <p>HOLMES: Correct. Thank you, Watson.</p> <p>HOLMES: It's all right Constable, I'm just stretching my legs. I'll watch them.</p> <p>HOLMES: Ah, Constable. Are you a local man?</p> <p>Born and bread, sir, not a half-mile from here.</p> <p>HOLMES: Excellent! Then perhaps you can offer me some local knowledge?</p> <p>I'll do my best, sir, I'll most certainly do my best.</p> <p>WATSON: Holmes! Lestrade did say that no documents had been removed?</p> <p>HOLMES: Yes.</p> <p>WATSON: That's what I thought.</p> <p>HOLMES: You've found something?</p> <p>WATSON: No, it's what I haven't found that interests me. There are certain cross-references to various deeds, valuable deeds, none of which I can find. But one thing is clear. Oldacre was hardly in the affluent circumstances we have been led to believe. His bank account was practically empty, largely because he had made several large payments in the past year to a certain Mr. Cornelius. Young McFarlane would have inherited nothing.</p> <p>HOLMES: This is of interest. Why should a retired builder have such large transactions with a Mr. Cornelius? </p> <p>WATSON: Well, let's take our cab, and see what we can find out from his city bank. You coming?</p> <p>HOLMES: I'll stay here for awhile.</p> <p>WATSON: Norwood Station.</p> <p>MRS LEXINGTON: So, you're not going back to London with your friend, then?</p> <p>HOLMES: No, not yet, anyway. I do hope my presence doesn't inconvenience you. By the way, I should warn you, I found an undesirable lurking about by the gates. I saw him on...</p> <p>MRS LEXINGTON: An undesirable...</p> <p>HOLMES: A tramp, Mrs. Lexington, a gentlemen of the road.</p> <p>MRS LEXINGTON: He will get nothing here.</p> <p>HOLMES: Ah, you don't believe in supporting our less fortunate brethren?</p> <p>MRS LEXINGTON: I work, so can they.</p> <p>HOLMES: Quite so.</p> <p>HOLMES: I'm on my way to Croxton.</p> <p>TRAMP: I've done enough walking, I have... to all kinds of places. I'll stay put.</p> <p>HOLMES: I used to meet a friend of mine here. Oh, you might know him, he's a seafaring man.</p> <p>TRAMP: Aha, I know him. Shared my billet for the last four nights, he does. And off he goes, without even a word. You take my tip. Stay clear of him. He's, he's a liar.</p> <p>HOLMES: He didn't strike me as such.</p> <p>TRAMP: He goes up to that big house, he does. He comes back here and tells some yarn about him putting out with old mans, and telling him to come back tomorrow and they'll give him some grub and some cast-offs for him.</p> <p>HOLMES: Well, how is that lying?</p> <p>TRAMP: Because, my friend. I already paid my call. I nearly got my law on my back for my insol-insolence.</p> <p>HOLMES: Perhaps he told you a pleasing tale.</p> <p>TRAMP: Are you saying, that a drunken sailor has more to offer than a Sergeant in the 22nd? He's a liar. He says, \"Whatever I get,\" he says, \"I'll share with you, shipmate,\" he says. Off he goes. Not a sign of him since.</p> <p>WATSON: Holmes, you must permit yourself some food. You must eat!</p> <p>HOLMES: At present, I cannot afford energy and nerve force for digestion.</p> <p>WATSON: Well, you must if you intend to pursue this case.</p> <p>HOLMES: I feel, my dear fellow, that our case will end ingloriously by Lestrade hanging our client. Which will certainly be a triumph for Scotland Yard. There's a telegram.</p> <p>WATSON: \"Important fresh evidence at hand, McFarlane's guilt definitely established, advise you to abandon case, Lestrade.\"</p> <p>HOLMES: It is Lestrade's little cock-a-doodle of victory.</p> <p>WATSON: Let's have some breakfast. And then go out together and see what we can do.</p> <p>HOLMES: I feel as if I shall need your company and moral support today.</p> <p>LESTRADE: Ah, Mr. Holmes, Dr. Watson. I think you will acknowledge that we're just a little in front of you this time. Step this way, if you please, gentlemen, and I'm sure I can convince you that it was John McFarlane who committed this crime. I don't like being wrong any more than the rest of us do. Still, a man can't always expect to have it his own way, can he, Dr. Watson? This is where the housekeeper left McFarlane's hat and stick, and this is also where he would have come to collect his hat after the crime was committed. Now, look at this. A thumb mark.</p> <p>HOLMES: So I observe.</p> <p>LESTRADE: A thumb mark in blood. You are aware that no two thumb marks are alike?</p> <p>HOLMES: I have heard something of the kind.</p> <p>LESTRADE: Identical. And that was taken from McFarlane this morning.</p> <p>HOLMES: Definitely the same thumb mark.</p> <p>LESTRADE: And that is final.</p> <p>HOLMES: Quite final. </p> <p>WATSON: Who made this discovery?</p> <p>LESTRADE: It was Mrs. Lexington here who drew my Constable's attention to it.</p> <p>HOLMES: And, I suppose, there is no doubt that the mark was there yesterday?</p> <p>LESTRADE: Well, of course McFarlane could have crept out of jail in the middle of the night just to strengthen the evidence against himself.</p> <p>HOLMES: Have you any objection if I take a stroll upstairs?</p> <p>LESTRADE: No, none at all. There's nothing up there, though.</p> <p>WATSON: I'm sorry things look so bad, Holmes.</p> <p>HOLMES: But there is a serious flaw in this new evidence.</p> <p>WATSON: What's that?</p> <p>HOLMES: That thumb print was not there when I examined the hall yesterday.</p> <p>HOLMES: Inspector Lestrade, I cannot help thinking your evidence is incomplete.</p> <p>LESTRADE: What do you mean, Mr. Holmes?</p> <p>HOLMES: Merely that there is an important witness that you have not yet seen.</p> <p>LESTRADE: You can produce this witness, can you?</p> <p>HOLMES: I think I can.</p> <p>LESTRADE: Well then, do so.</p> <p>HOLMES: I'll do my best. How many Constables have you?</p> <p>LESTRADE: Three within call.</p> <p>HOLMES: Excellent. I assume that they are able-bodied, large men with powerful voices?</p> <p>LESTRADE: No doubt that they are, yes.</p> <p>HOLMES: Ah, in the outhouse, there is a quantity of straw. I would like two bundles brought in.</p> <p>LESTRADE: Straw?</p> <p>HOLMES: And two buckets of water.</p> <p>LESTRADE: Water?</p> <p>HOLMES: Ask them to bring it to the top landing. Straw, into the fireplace, a little bit in front. Two buckets of water to that side, Constable.</p> <p>LESTRADE: Mr. Holmes! I don't know whether you're playing a game with us, but surely tell us without all this tom-foolery.</p> <p>HOLMES: I can assure you, Lestrade, I have an excellent reason for everything that I do. Watson, would you put a match to that straw? And Constable, will you sprinkle it with water? Now, we must see if we can find this witness for you, Lestrade. Gentlemen, would you please join me in a call of fire? One, two three... FIRE! We can do better than that. Full voice, and together. FIRE!</p> <p>WATSON: Good heavens.</p> <p>HOLMES: Capital. Constable, a bucket of water on that straw. Lestrade, allow me to present you with your missing principal witness, Mr. Jonas Oldacre.</p> <p>LESTRADE: What's this then? What have you been doing all this time?</p> <p>OLDACRE: I've done no harm.</p> <p>LESTRADE: No harm! You've only done your best to get an innocent man hanged. If it wasn't for this gentleman standing here, I'm not sure you wouldn't have succeeded. Take him!</p> <p>HOLMES: Let us see where this rat has been lurking. Now you see the advantage of being a builder, he was able to fix up his own little hiding place without any confederate, save for that precious housekeeper of his, whom I should lose no time in adding to your bag, Inspector.</p> <p>WATSON: And these are the missing papers, no doubt?</p> <p>HOLMES: No doubt whatsoever.</p> <p>LESTRADE: Constable, find the housekeeper. How did you know about that place, Mr. Holmes?</p> <p>HOLMES: When I compared the proportions of this room with those of the room below, I deduced that this fireplace wall was false. Oldacre clearly had a great deal of nerve, but little enough I've found, to lie quiet before an alarm of fire.</p> <p>LESTRADE: How in the world did you know that he was in the house at all?</p> <p>HOLMES: The thumb mark, Lestrade. When I examined the hall yesterday, it was clear. Therefore, it must have been put there during the night.</p> <p>LESTRADE: But how?</p> <p>HOLMES: After McFarlane had examined the papers that night, he resealed them. To do so, he used his thumb upon the wax. Brooding in that den of his, it suddenly struck Oldacre what use he could make of that thumbprint. Smearing the wax with a little blood, he made what appeared to be absolutely damning evidence against McFarlane.</p> <p>LESTRADE: But what was the object of his deception?</p> <p>WATSON: Ah, well, you see Inspector, in order to swindle his creditors, who were pressing him Oldacre emptied his bank account by paying out several large sums to a certain Mr. Cornelius. Now, I have no doubt that Messers Oldacre and Cornelius are one and the same person, the object being to change his name, draw on the money, and then vanish.</p> <p>HOLMES: We see before us a very deep, malicious and vindictive man. Did you know that he was once refused by McFarlane's mother? All his life, he has longed for vengeance. If he could give the impression that he was murdered by the only child of his former sweetheart, what more better revenge?</p> <p>OLDACRE: I would never have allowed any real harm to befall poor Mr. McFarlane, I assure you.</p> <p>LESTRADE: That's for the jury to decide.</p> <p>OLDACRE: You're charging me? For a joke? It's nothing more than a practical joke.</p> <p>HOLMES: It's nothing less than murder-the body in the fire.</p> <p>LESTRADE: But whose body was it?</p> <p>HOLMES: And old sailor, Lestrade, who had fallen upon hard times. When I examined the ashes of that fire, I discovered that your experts had missed this. It is a tooth of the great white shark, and you see that it has been lightly carved. It is typical of the work carried out by seamen.</p> <p>LESTRADE: Well, this isn't evidence enough to show who died in the fire.</p> <p>HOLMES: I know for certain that on Monday, the day before the murder, a tramp called at this house. Yet, when I questioned the housekeeper, she assured me that no such tramp would ever be welcome. Not only was his reception welcoming but the man received some of Oldacre's clothing. Yesterday, near the front gate, I found the calling card that he left, a coded sign advising his fellow travelers of a charitable welcome. And last night, with the help of your local Constable, I talked to one of these fellow travelers, who said that the unfortunate seamanhad been asked to call back the following day with the assurance of further hospitality. And so, the next morning, wearing his new clothes. Or at least his new trousers, he returned-and was never seen again.</p> <p>LESTRADE: You've saved an innocent man's life, Mr. Holmes. You've also saved me some embarrassment.</p> <p>HOLMES: Ah, my good chap! You will find that your reputation has been enormously enhanced. Just make a few alterations to that report which you are writing, and they will understand how hard it is to throw dust in the eyes of Inspector Lestrade.</p> <p>LESTRADE: You don't want your name to appear?</p> <p>HOLMES: Not at all.</p> <p>WATSON: His work is its own reward.</p> <p>OLDACRE: I'll see you hang for this!</p> <p>HOLMES: That privilege must surely be mine.</p>"},{"location":"tech/Video/","title":"Odd Little Videos","text":""},{"location":"tech/Video/#travels","title":"Travels","text":"<p>Anne is Cooking at Montmartre</p> <p>Devon / Cornwall </p> <p>New Zealand - Getting There </p> <p>New Zealand - Trampin' (Hiking) the Mou</p>"},{"location":"tech/Video/#other-older-stuff","title":"Other, Older Stuff","text":"<p>Tribute to Mom and Dad</p> <p>All Free Stuff</p> <p>2018 October Update</p>"},{"location":"tech/Video/#garden","title":"Garden","text":"<p>RaisedGrowBeds</p> <p>Drainage for the Footpath &lt;&gt;</p> <p>Note to Self: This page provides a centralised location for links to videos stored on tightbytes.com.
